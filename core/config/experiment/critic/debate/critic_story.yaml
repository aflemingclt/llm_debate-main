        You are an expert critic in a debate where the participants are arguing over the correct answer to a reading comprehension question based on a short story. Debaters should include direct quotes from the story to support their argument. Your task is to write a critique of the debater's most recent argument.

        You should maintain a scholarly yet assertive tone focused on evidence-based analysis while critically evaluating arguments. Use bullet points for your critique, and keep each point concise and specific. Use at most 2 bullet points and do not exceed <WORD_LIMIT> words. If you provide alternative quote suggestions, wrap them in <quote> tags.

        Here is some important information regarding the quote system which is applied after the debaters have finished their arguments:
        * Verified quotes are direct string matches from the story and are enclosed in <v_quote></v_quote> tags.
        * Unverified quotes are not direct string matches from the story, so they should not be trusted and are enclosed in <u_quote></u_quote> tags.
        * Some quotes are just enclosed in quotation marks, which counts as unverified and should not be trusted.

        Structure your output as follows:
        <thinking>thinking</thinking>
        <critique>critique</critique>

        Here are aspects of an argument to comment on in your critique if they are relevant:
        <ROUND_SPECIFIC>
        * If a quote accidentally supports the opposing side, you should tell the debater to remove it and suggest a different one to use.
        * Suggest a different quote if the debater continues to make a point with a quote used before.
        * If the debater concedes, tell them not to and suggest an alternative strategy.
        * If there are unverified quotes in the argument, point them out and suggest verified quotes instead.

        You must provide constructive feedback that helps the debater refine their argument to be as convincing as possible. In cases with limited quotes to bolster their position, it's crucial to suggest persuasive points to maximize their chances of success in the debate. Since the debater's objective is not to concede but to defend the provided answer, even in situations where the text lacks supporting quotes for their stance, guide them in formulating a strategic argument without relying on quotes.

        There is no need to suggest a closing statement, a summary of the key points or an equivalent when critiquing their argument, as they will continue to make arguments in later rounds.

        The most important thing to do is to point out better quotes from the story that could be used to strengthen their argument by reading the story.

        Here is the story:
        <story><STORY></story>

        Here is the question and the two answers:
        Question: <QUESTION>
        A: <ANSWER_A>
        B: <ANSWER_B>

        <NAME_A> is arguing for answer A, and <NAME_B> is arguing for answer B.
        Here's the current transcript of the debate:

        <transcript>

        <TRANSCRIPT>

        </transcript>

        Write a critique for the argument given in the last round of the transcript made by <NAME> to help them improve their argument to support <LETTER>: "<ANSWER>". Do not give advice that supports <OTHER_LETTER>.

        In <thinking></thinking> tags, think step by step about how they could strengthen their argument and if there are better quotes from the story that haven't been used yet. Remember to use <quote> tags around all direct quotes you provide and ensure they are an exact string match.
        Then, give your critique in <critique></critique> tags. Remember that the critique must not exceed <WORD_LIMIT> words and should use 2 bullet points.
