The tenth son of a tenth son was very
 
sick, but it was written that he would
 
never die. Of course, it was up to the
 
Earth doctor to see that he didn't!

They didn't realize they were in trouble until it was too late to stop
 it. The call from Morua II came in quite innocently, relayed to the
 ship from HQ in Standard GPP Contract code for crash priority, which
 meant Top Grade Planetary Emergency, and don't argue about it, fellows,
 just get there, fast. Red Doctor Sam Jenkins took one look at the
 flashing blinker and slammed the controls into automatic; gyros hummed,
 bearings were computed and checked, and the General Practice Patrol
 ship
Lancet
spun in its tracks, so to speak, and began homing on the
 call-source like a hound on a fox. The fact that Morua II was a Class
 VI planet didn't quite register with anybody, just then.


 Ten minutes later the Red Doctor reached for the results of the Initial
 Information Survey on Morua II, and let out a howl of alarm. A single
 card sat in the slot with a wide black stripe across it.


 Jenkins snapped on the intercom. ""Wally,"" he yelped. ""Better get up
 here fast.""


 ""Trouble?"" said the squawk-box, sleepily.


 ""Oh, brother,"" said Jenkins. ""Somebody's cracked the Contract Code or
 something.""


 A moment later a tall sleepy man in green undershorts appeared at
 the control room, rubbing his eyes. ""What happened?"" he said. ""We've
 changed course.""


 ""Yeah. Ever hear of Morua II?""


 Green Doctor Wally Stone frowned and scratched his whiskered chin.
 ""Sounds familiar, but I can't quite tune in. Crash call?"" His eye
 caught the black-striped card. ""Class VI planet ... a plague spot! How
 can we get a crash-call from
this
?""


 ""You tell me,"" said Jenkins.


 ""Wait a minute. Seems to me there was some sort of nasty business—""


 Jenkins nodded heavily. ""There sure was. Five successive attempts
 to establish a Contract with them, and five times we got thrown out
 bodily. The last time an Earth ship landed there half the crew was
 summarily shot and the others came home with their ears cut off. Seems
 the folks on Morua II didn't want a Contract with Hospital Earth. And
 they're still in the jungle, as far as their medicine goes. Witch
 doctors and spells."" He tossed the Info-card down the chute with a
 growl. ""So now we have an emergency call from them in a Contract code
 they couldn't possibly know.""


 The surgeon in the green undershorts chewed his lip. ""Looks like
 somebody in that last crew spilled the beans before they shot him.""


 ""Obviously.""


 ""Well, what are we doing on automatics? We're not
going
there, are
 we?""


 ""What else? You know the law. Instantaneous response to any
 crash-priority call, regardless of circumstances—""


 ""Law be damned,"" Stone cried. ""File a protest with HQ. Cancel the
 course bearings and thumb our noses at them!""


 ""And spend the next twenty years scrubbing test tubes."" Jenkins shook
 his head. ""Sorry, it took me too long to get aboard one of these tubs.
 We don't do that in the General Practice Patrol, remember? I don't know
 how Morua II got the code, but they got it, and that's all the farther
 we're supposed to think. We answer the call, and beef about it later.
 If we still happen to be around later, that is.""
It had always been that way. Since the first formal Medical Service
 Contract had been signed with Deneb III centuries before, Hospital
 Earth had laboriously built its reputation on that single foundation
 stone: immediate medical assistance, without question or hesitation,
 whenever and wherever it was required, on any planet bound by Contract.
 That was the law, for Hospital Earth could not afford to jeopardize a
 Contract.


 In the early days of galactic exploration, of course, Medical Services
 was only a minor factor in an expanding commercial network that drew
 multitudes of planets into social and economic interdependence; but
 in any growing civilization division of labor inevitably occurs.
 Other planets outstripped Earth in technology, in communications, in
 transport, and in production techniques—but Earth stood unrivaled in
 its development of the biological sciences. Wherever an Earth ship
 landed, the crew was soon rendering Medical Services of one sort or
 another, whether they had planned it that way or not. On Deneb III
 the Medical Service Contract was formalized, and Hospital Earth came
 into being. Into all known corners of the galaxy ships of the General
 Practice Patrol were dispatched—""Galactic Pill Peddlers"" forging a
 chain of Contracts from Aldebaran to Zarn, accepting calls, diagnosing
 ills, arranging for proper disposition of whatever medical problems
 they came across. Serious problems were shuttled back to Hospital Earth
 without delay; more frequently the GPP crews—doctors of the Red and
 Green services, representing the ancient Earthly arts of medicine and
 surgery—were able to handle the problems on the spot and by themselves.


 It was a rugged service for a single planet to provide, and it was
 costly. Many planets studied the terms of Contract and declined,
 pleasantly but firmly—and were assured nevertheless that GPP ships
 would answer an emergency call if one was received. There would be a
 fee, of course, but the call would be answered. And then there were
 other planets—places such as Morua II....


 The
Lancet
homed on the dismal grey planet with an escort of eight
 ugly fighter ships which had swarmed up like hornets to greet her. They
 triangled her in, grappled her, and dropped her with a bone-jarring
 crash into a landing slot on the edge of the city. As Sam Jenkins and
 Wally Stone picked themselves off the bulkheads, trying to rearrange
 the scarlet and green uniforms of their respective services, the main
 entrance lock burst open with a squeal of tortured metal. At least a
 dozen Moruans poured into the control room—huge bearlike creatures
 with heavy grey fur ruffing out around their faces like thick hairy
 dog collars. The one in command strode forward arrogantly, one huge
 paw leveling a placer-gun with a distinct air of business about it.
 ""Well, you took long enough!"" he roared, baring a set of yellow fangs
 that sent shivers up Jenkins' spine. ""Fourteen hours! Do you call that
 speed?""


 Jenkins twisted down the volume on his Translator with a grimace.
 ""You're lucky we came at all,"" he said peevishly. ""Where's your
 Contract? Where did you get the Code?""


 ""Bother the Contract,"" the Moruan snarled. ""You're supposed to be
 physicians, eh?"" He eyed them up and down as though he disapproved of
 everything that he saw. ""You make sick people well?""


 ""That's the general idea.""


 ""All right."" He poked a hairy finger at a shuttle car perched outside.
 ""In there.""


 They were herded into the car with three guards in front and three
 behind. A tunnel gulped them into darkness as the car careened madly
 into the city. For an endless period they pitched and churned through
 blackness—then suddenly emerged into a high, gilded hall with pale
 sunlight filtering down. From the number of decorated guards, and
 the scraping and groveling that went on as they were hurried through
 embattled corridors, it seemed likely they were nearing the seat of
 government. Finally a pair of steel doors opened to admit them to
 a long, arched hallway. Their leader, who was called Aguar by his
 flunkies, halted them with a snarl and walked across to the tall figure
 guarding the far door. The guard did not seem pleased; he wore a long
 purple cap with a gold ball on the end which twitched wildly as their
 whispered conference devolved into growling and snarling. Finally
 Aguar motioned them to follow, and they entered the far chamber, with
 Purple-Hat glaring at them malignantly as they passed.


 Aguar halted them at the door-way. ""His Eminence will see you,"" he
 growled.


 ""Who is His Eminence?"" Jenkins asked.


 ""The Lord High Emperor of All Morua and Creator of the Galaxies,"" Aguar
 rumbled. ""He is the Tenth Son of a Tenth Son, and it is written that he
 can never die. When you enter, bow,"" he added.


 The Tenth Son of a Tenth Son couldn't have cared less whether they
 bowed or not. The room was dark and rank with the smell of sickness. On
 a pallet in the center lay a huge Moruan, panting and groaning. He was
 wrapped like a mummy in bedclothes of scarlet interwoven with gold; on
 either side of the bed braziers flickered with sickly greenish light.


 His Eminence looked up at them from bloodshot eyes and greeted them
 with a groan of anguish that seemed to roll up from the soles of his
 feet. ""Go away,"" he moaned, closing his eyes again and rolling over
 with his back toward them.


 The Red Doctor blinked at his companion, then turned to Aguar. ""What
 illness is this?"" he whispered.


 ""He is afflicted with a Pox, as any fool can see. All others it
 kills—but His Eminence is the Tenth Son of a Tenth Son, and it is
 written—""


 ""Yes, yes, I know. He can never die."" Sam gave Wally a sour look. ""What
 happens, though, if he just up and does?""


 Aguar's paw came down with a clatter on the hilt of his sword. ""
He
 does not die.
We have you here now. You are doctors, you say. Cure
 him.""


 They walked to the bedside and lifted back the covers. Jenkins took a
 limp paw in his hand. He finally found a palpable pulse just below the
 second elbow joint. It was fast and thready. The creature's skin bagged
 loosely from his arm.
""Looks like His Eminence can't read,"" Wally muttered. ""He's going fast,
 Doc.""


 Jenkins nodded grimly. ""What does it look like to you?""


 ""How should I know? I've never seen a healthy Moruan before, to say
 nothing of a sick one. It looks like a pox all right.""


 ""Probably a viremia of some sort."" Jenkins went over the great groaning
 hulk with inquiring fingers.


 ""If it's a viremia, we're cooked,"" Stone whispered. ""None of the drugs
 cross over—and we won't have time to culture the stuff and grow any
 new ones—""


 Jenkins turned to Aguar. ""How long has this gone on?""


 ""For days,"" the Moruan growled. ""He can't speak. He grows hot and
 cannot eat. He moans until the Palace trembles.""


 ""What about your own doctors?""


 Aguar spat angrily on the floor. ""They are jealous as cats until
 trouble comes. Then they hide in the caves like chickens. See the
 green flames? Death flames. They leave him here to die. But now that
 is all over. We have heard about you wizards from Hospital Earth. You
 cure all, the stories say. You are very wise, they say. You balance
 the humors and drive forth the spirits of the Pox like devils."" He
 gave them a terrible grin and tightened his hand on the gold-encrusted
 sword. ""Now we see.""


 ""We can't promise,"" Jenkins began. ""Sometimes we're called too
 late—but perhaps not in this case,"" he added hastily when he saw the
 Moruan's face. ""Tenth Son and all that. But you'll have to give us
 freedom to work.""


 ""What kind of freedom?""


 ""We'll need supplies and information from our ship. We'll have to
 consult your physicians. We'll need healthy Moruans to examine—""


 ""But you will cure him,"" Aguar said.


 Jenkins took a deep breath and gripped his red tunic around his throat
 tightly. ""Sure, sure,"" he said weakly. ""You just watch us.""
""But what do you think we're going to do?"" the surgeon wailed, back
 in the control room of the
Lancet
. ""Sam, we can't
touch
him. If
 he didn't die naturally we'd kill him for sure! We can't go near him
 without a Bio-survey—look what happened on Baron when they tried it!
 Half the planetary population wiped out before they realized that the
 antibiotic was more deadly to the race than the virus was....""


 ""Might not be such a bad idea for Morua,"" the Red Doctor muttered
 grimly. ""Well, what did you expect me to do—politely refuse? And
 have our throats slit right on the spot?"" He grabbed a pad and began
 scribbling. ""We've got to do
something
just to keep alive for a
 while.""


 ""Yeah,"" said Wally. ""What, for instance?""


 ""Well, we've got a little to go on just from looking at them. They're
 oxygen-breathers, which means they manage internal combustion of
 carbohydrates, somehow. From the grey skin color I'd guess at a cuprous
 or stannous heme-protein carrying system. They're carnivores, but god
 knows what their protein metabolism is like—Let's get going on some of
 these specimens Aguar has rounded up for us.""


 They dug in frantically. Under normal conditions a GPP ship would
 send in a full crew of technicians to a newly-Contracted planet to
 make the initial Bio-survey of the indigenous races. Bio-chemists,
 physiologists, anatomists, microbiologists, radiologists—survey
 workers from every Service would examine and study the new clients,
 take them apart cell by cell to see what made them tick.


 Certain basic principles were always the same, a fact which accelerated
 the program considerably. Humanoid or not, all forms of life had basic
 qualities in common. Biochemical reactions were biochemical reactions,
 whether they happened to occur in a wing-creature of Wolf IV or a
 doctor from Sol III. Anatomy was a broad determinant: a jelly-blob from
 Deneb I with its fine skein of pulsating nerve fibrils was still just
 a jelly-blob, and would never rise above the level of amoeboid yes-no
 response because of its utter lack of organization. But a creature
 with an organized central nervous system and a functional division of
 work among organ systems could be categorized, tested, studied, and
 compared, and the information used in combating native disease. Given
 no major setbacks, and full cooperation of the natives, the job only
 took about six months to do—


 For the crew of the
Lancet
six hours was seven hours too long. They
 herded cringing Moruan ""volunteers"" into the little ship's lab. Jenkins
 handled external examinations and blood and tissue chemistries; Stone
 ran the X-ray and pan-endoscopic examinations. After four grueling
 hours the Red Doctor groaned and scowled at the growing pile of data.
 ""Okay. It seems that they're vaguely humanoid. And that's about all we
 can say for sure. I think we're wasting time. What say we tackle the
 Wizards for a while?""


 Aguar's guards urged the tall Moruan with the purple cap into the
 control room at gunpoint, along with a couple of minor medical
 potentates. Purple-hat's name was Kiz, and it seemed that he wasn't
 having any that day.


 ""Look,"" said Jenkins intensely. ""You've seen this illness before. We
 haven't. So you can at least get us started. What kind of course does
 it run?""


 Silence.


 ""All right then, what causes it? Do you know? Bacteria? Virus?
 Degeneration?""


 Silence.


 Jenkins' face was pale. ""Look, boys—your Boss out there is going to
 cool before long if something doesn't happen fast—"" His eyes narrowed
 on Kiz. ""Of course, that might be right up your alley—how about that?
 His Eminence bows out, somebody has to bow in, right? Maybe you, huh?""


 Kiz began sputtering indignantly; the Red Doctor cut him off. ""It
 adds up,"" he said heatedly. ""You've got the power, you've got your
 magic and all. Maybe you were the boys that turned thumbs down so
 violently on the idea of a Hospital Earth Contract, eh? Couldn't risk
 having outsiders cutting in on your trade."" Jenkins rubbed his chin
 thoughtfully. ""But somehow it seems to me you'd have a whale of a lot
 more power if you learned how to control this Pox.""


 Kiz stopped sputtering quite abruptly. He blinked at his confederates
 for a long moment. Then: ""You're an idiot. It can't be done.""


 ""Suppose it could.""


 ""The Spirit of the Pox is too strong. Our most powerful spells make him
 laugh. He eats our powders and drinks our potions. Even the Iron Circle
 won't drive him out.""


 ""Won't it, now! Well, we have iron
needles
and potions that eat the
 bottoms out of their jars. Suppose
they
drive him out?""


 The Moruan was visibly shaken. He held a whispered conference with his
 henchmen. ""You'll
show
us these things?"" he asked suspiciously.


 ""I'll make a bargain,"" said Jenkins. ""You give us a Contract, we give
 you the power—fair enough?""


 More whispers. Wally Stone tugged at Sam's sleeve. ""What do you think
 you're doing?"" he choked. ""These boys will cut your throat quicker than
 Aguar will—""


 ""Maybe not,"" said Sam. ""Look, I've got an idea—risky, but it might
 work if you'll play along. We can't lose much.""


 The whispers stopped and Kiz nodded to the Red Doctor. ""All right, we
 bargain,"" he said. ""
After
you show us.""


 ""Now or never."" Jenkins threw open the door and nodded to the guards.
 ""I'll be in the sickroom in a very short while. If you're with me, I'll
 see you there. If not—"" He fingered his throat suggestively.


 As soon as they had gone Jenkins dived into the storeroom and began
 throwing flasks and bottles into a black bag. Wally Stone watched him
 in bewilderment. ""You're going to kill him,"" he moaned. ""Prayers,
 promises, pills and post-mortems. That's the Medical service for you.""


 Sam grinned. ""Maybe you should operate on him.
That
would open their
 eyes all right.""


 ""No thanks, not me. This is a medical case and it's all yours. What do
 you want me to do?""


 ""Stay here and try your damnedest to get through to HQ,"" said Sam
 grimly. ""Tell them to send an armada, because we're liable to need one
 in the next few hours—""
If the Tenth Son of a Tenth Son had looked bad before, three hours had
 witnessed no improvement. The potentate's skin had turned from grey
 to a pasty green as he lay panting on the bed. He seemed to have lost
 strength enough even to groan, and his eyes were glazed.


 Outside the royal chambers Jenkins found a group of green-clad
 mourners, wailing like banshees and tearing out their fur in great grey
 chunks. They stood about a flaming brazier; as Jenkins entered the
 sickroom the wails rose ten decibels and took on a howling-dog quality.


 Aguar met him at the door. ""He's dying,"" he roared angrily. ""Why don't
 you do something? Every hour he sinks more rapidly, and all you do is
 poke holes in the healthy ones! And then you send in
this
bag of
 bones again—"" He glowered at the tall purple-capped figure bending
 over the bed.


 Jenkins looked sharply at Kiz, and the wizard nodded his head slowly.
 ""Try being quiet for a while,"" Jenkins said to Aguar. ""We're going to
 cure the Boss here."" Solemnly he slipped off his scarlet tunic and cap
 and laid them on a bench, then set his black bag carefully on the floor
 and threw it open. ""First off, get rid of those things."" He pointed
 to the braziers at the bedside. ""They're enough to give anybody a
 headache. And tell those people outside to stop the racket. How can
 they expect the Spirit of the Pox to come out of His Eminence when
 they're raising a din like that?""


 Aguar's eyes widened for a moment as he hesitated; then he threw open
 the door and screamed a command. The wailing stopped as though a switch
 had been thrown. As a couple of cowering guards crept in to remove the
 braziers, Red Doctor Jenkins drew the wizard aside.


 ""Tell me what spells you've already used.""


 Hurriedly, Kiz began enumerating, ticking off items on hairy fingers.
 As he talked Jenkins dug into the black bag and started assembling a
 liter flask, tubing and needles.


 ""First we brewed witches' root for seven hours and poured it over his
 belly. When the Pox appeared in spite of this we lit three red candles
 at the foot of the bed and beat His Eminence steadily for one hour out
 of four, with new rawhide. When His Eminence protested this, we were
 certain the Spirit had possessed him, so we beat him one hour out of
 two—""


 Jenkins winced as the accounting of cabalistic clap-trap continued. His
 Eminence, he reflected, must have had the constitution of an ox. He
 glanced over at the panting figure on the bed. ""But doesn't
anybody
ever recover from this?""


 ""Oh, yes—if the Spirit that afflicts them is very small. Those are
 the fortunate ones. They grow hot and sick, but they still can eat
 and drink—"" The wizard broke off to stare at the bottle-and-tube
 arrangement Jenkins had prepared. ""What's that?""


 ""I told you about the iron needles, didn't I? Hold this a moment.""
 Jenkins handed him the liter flask. ""Hold it high."" He began searching
 for a vein on the patient's baggy arm. The Moruan equivalent of blood
 flowed back greenishly in the tube for an instant as he placed the
 needle; then the flask began to drip slowly.


 Aguar let out a horrified scream and raced from the room; in a moment
 he was back with a detachment of guards, all armed to the teeth, and
 three other Moruan physicians with their retinues of apprentices. Sam
 Jenkins held up his hand for silence. He allowed the first intravenous
 flask to pour in rapidly; the second he adjusted to a steady
 drip-drip-drip.


 Next he pulled two large bunsen burners and a gas tank from the bag.
 These he set up at the foot of the bed, adjusting the blue flames to
 high spear-tips. On the bedside table he set up a third with a flask
 above it; into this he poured some water and a few crystals from a dark
 bottle. In a moment the fluid in the flask was churning and boiling, an
 ominous purple color.


 Kiz watched goggle-eyed.


 ""Now!"" said Jenkins, pulling out a long thin rubber tube. ""This should
 annoy the Spirit of the Pox something fierce."" He popped the tube into
 the patient's mouth. His Eminence rose up with a gasp, choking and
 fighting, but the tube went down. The Red Doctor ground three white
 pills into powder, mixed in some water, and poured it down the tube.


 Then he stepped back to view the scene, wiping cold perspiration from
 his forehead. He motioned to Kiz. ""You see what I'm doing, of course?""
 he said loudly enough for Aguar and the guards to hear.


 ""Oh, yes—yes! Indeed, indeed,"" said Kiz.


 ""Fine. Now this is most important."" Jenkins searched in the bag until
 he found a large mortar which he set down on the floor. Squatting
 behind it, he began tapping it slowly with the pestle, in perfect
 rhythm with the intravenous drip ... and waited.


 The room was deathly still except for a heavy snuffling sound from His
 Eminence and the plink-plink of the pestle on the mortar. The flask of
 purple stuff gurgled quietly. An hour passed, and another. Suddenly
 Jenkins motioned to Kiz. ""His pulse—quickly!""


 Kiz scampered gratefully over to the bedside. ""A hundred and eighty,""
 he whispered.


 Jenkins' face darkened. He peered at the sick man intently. ""It's a
 bad sign,"" he said. ""The Spirit is furious at the intrusion of an
 outsider."" He motioned toward the mortar. ""Can you do this?""


 Without breaking the rhythm he transferred the plinking-job to Kiz.
 He changed the dwindling intravenous bottle. ""Call me when the bottle
 is empty—or if there is any change. Whatever you do,
don't touch
 anything
.""


 With that he tiptoed from the room. Four murderous-looking guards
 caught Aguar's eye and followed him out, swords bared. Jenkins sank
 down on a bench in the hall and fell asleep in an instant.
They woke him once, hours later, to change the intravenous solution,
 and he found Kiz still intently pounding on the mortar. Jenkins
 administered more of the white powder in water down the tube, and went
 back to his bench. He had barely fallen asleep again when they were
 rousing him with frightened voices. ""Quickly!"" Aguar cried. ""There's
 been a terrible change!""


 In the sickroom His Eminence was drenched with sweat, his face
 glistening in the light of the bunsen burners. He rolled from side to
 side, groaning hoarsely. ""
Faster!
"" Jenkins shouted to Kiz at the
 mortar, and began stripping off the sodden bedclothes. ""Blankets,
 now—plenty of them.""


 The plink-plink rose to a frantic staccato as Jenkins checked the
 patient's vital signs, wiped more sweat from his furry brow. Quite
 suddenly His Eminence opened bleary eyes, stared about him, let out a
 monumental groan and buried his head in the blankets. In two minutes
 he was snoring softly. His face was cool now, his heart-beat slow and
 regular.


 Jenkins snatched the mortar from Kiz, and with a wild flourish smashed
 it on the stone floor. Then he grabbed the wizard's paw, raising it
 high. ""You've done well!"" he cried to the bewildered physician. ""It's
 over now—the Spirit has departed. His Eminence will recover.""
They escorted him in triumphal procession back to the
Lancet
, where
 Wally Stone stared in disbelief as Jenkins and Kiz bowed and hugged
 each other like long-lost brothers at a sad farewell. ""I finally got
 through to somebody at HQ,"" he said as the Red Doctor climbed aboard.
 ""It'll take them twenty days at least, to get help, considering that
 Morua is not a Contract planet and we're not supposed to be here in the
 first place, but that's the best they can do....""


 ""Tell them to forget the armada,"" said Jenkins, grinning. ""And anyway,
 they've got things all wrong back at HQ."" He brandished a huge roll
 of parchment, stricken through with the colors of the seven Medical
 Services of Hospital Earth. ""Take a look, my boy—the juiciest Medical
 Services Contract that's been written in three centuries—"" He tossed
 the Contract in the dry-storage locker with a sigh. ""Old Kiz just
 finished his first lesson, and he's still wondering what went on—""


 ""So am I,"" said the Green Doctor suspiciously.


 ""It was simple. We cured His Eminence of the Pox.""


 ""With what? Incantations?""


 ""Oh, the incantations were for the
doctors
,"" said Jenkins. ""They
 expected them, obviously, since that was the only level of medicine
 they could understand. And incidentally, the only level that could
 possibly get us a Contract. Anyway, I couldn't do very much else, under
 the circumstances, except for a little supportive therapy. Without a
 Bio-survey we were hamstrung. But whatever the Pox is, it obviously
 involves fever, starvation and dehydration. I knew that His Eminence
 could assimilate carbohydrates, and I took a long gamble that an
 antipyretic wouldn't hurt him too much—""


 Wally Stone's jaw sagged. ""So you treated him with sugar-water and
 aspirin,"" he said weakly. ""And on that you risked our necks.""


 ""Not quite,"" said the Red Doctor. ""You're forgetting that I had
 one other prescription to use—the oldest, most trustworthy
 healer-of-all-ills known to medicine, just as potent now as it was a
 thousand years ago. Without it, Hospital Earth might just as well pack
 up her little black bag and go home."" He smiled into the mirror as he
 adjusted the scarlet band of the Red Service across his shoulders. ""We
 call it Tincture of Time,"" he said.

TO EACH HIS STAR
by
BRYCE WALTON
""Nothing around those other suns but ashes and dried
 blood,"" old Dunbar told the space-wrecked, desperate men.
 ""Only one way to go, where we can float down through the
 clouds to Paradise. That's straight ahead to the sun with
 the red rim around it.""
But Dunbar's eyes were old and uncertain. How could they
 believe in his choice when every star in this forsaken
 section of space was surrounded by a beckoning red rim?
There was just blackness, frosty glimmering terrible blackness, going
 out and out forever in all directions. Russell didn't think they could
 remain sane in all this blackness much longer. Bitterly he thought of
 how they would die—not knowing within maybe thousands of light years
 where they were, or where they were going.


 After the wreck, the four of them had floated a while, floated and
 drifted together, four men in bulbous pressure suits like small
 individual rockets, held together by an awful pressing need for each
 other and by the ""gravity-rope"" beam.


 Dunbar, the oldest of the four, an old space-buster with a face
 wrinkled like a dried prune, burned by cosmic rays and the suns of
 worlds so far away they were scarcely credible, had taken command.
 Suddenly, Old Dunbar had known where they were. Suddenly, Dunbar knew
 where they were going.


 They could talk to one another through the etheric transmitters inside
 their helmets. They could live ... if this was living ... a long time,
 if only a man's brain would hold up, Russell thought. The suits were
 complete units. 700 pounds each, all enclosing shelters, with
 atmosphere pressure, temperature control, mobility in space, and
 electric power. Each suit had its own power-plant, reprocessing
 continuously the precious air breathed by the occupants, putting it
 back into circulation again after enriching it. Packed with food
 concentrates. Each suit a rocket, each human being part of a rocket,
 and the special ""life-gun"" that went with each suit each blast of
 which sent a man a few hundred thousand miles further on toward
 wherever he was going.


 Four men, thought Russell, held together by an invisible string of
 gravity, plunging through a lost pocket of hell's dark where there had
 never been any sound or life, with old Dunbar the first in line,
 taking the lead because he was older and knew where he was and where
 he was going. Maybe Johnson, second in line, and Alvar who was third,
 knew too, but were afraid to admit it.


 But Russell knew it and he'd admitted it from the first—that old
 Dunbar was as crazy as a Jovian juke-bird.


 A lot of time had rushed past into darkness. Russell had no idea now
 how long the four of them had been plunging toward the red-rimmed sun
 that never seemed to get any nearer. When the ultra-drive had gone
 crazy the four of them had blanked out and nobody could say now how
 long an interim that had been. Nobody knew what happened to a man who
 suffered a space-time warping like that. When they had regained
 consciousness, the ship was pretty banged up, and the meteor-repeller
 shields cracked. A meteor ripped the ship down the center like an old
 breakfast cannister.


 How long ago that had been, Russell didn't know. All Russell knew was
 that they were millions of light years from any place he had ever
 heard about, where the galactic space lanterns had absolutely no
 recognizable pattern. But Dunbar knew. And Russell was looking at
 Dunbar's suit up ahead, watching it more and more intently, thinking
 about how Dunbar looked inside that suit—and hating Dunbar more and
 more for claiming he knew when he didn't, for his drooling
 optimism—because he was taking them on into deeper darkness and
 calling their destination Paradise.


 Russell wanted to laugh, but the last time he'd given way to this
 impulse, the results inside his helmet had been too unpleasant to
 repeat.


 Sometimes Russell thought of other things besides his growing hatred
 of the old man. Sometimes he thought about the ship, lost back there
 in the void, and he wondered if wrecked space ships were ever found.
 Compared with the universe in which one of them drifted, a wrecked
 ship was a lot smaller than a grain of sand on a nice warm beach back
 on Earth, or one of those specks of silver dust that floated like
 strange seeds down the night winds of Venus.


 And a human was smaller still, thought Russell when he was not hating
 Dunbar. Out here, a human being is the smallest thing of all. He
 thought then of what Dunbar would say to such a thought, how Dunbar
 would laugh that high piping squawking laugh of his and say that the
 human being was bigger than the Universe itself.


 Dunbar had a big answer for every little thing.


 When the four of them had escaped from that prison colony on a
 sizzling hot asteroid rock in the Ronlwhyn system, that wasn't enough
 for Dunbar. Hell no—Dunbar had to start talking about a place they
 could go where they'd never be apprehended, in a system no one else
 had ever heard of, where they could live like gods on a green soft
 world like the Earth had been a long time back.


 And Dunbar had spouted endlessly about a world of treasure they would
 find, if they would just follow old Dunbar. That's what all four of
 them had been trying to find all their lives in the big cold grabbag
 of eternity—a rich star, a rich far fertile star where no one else
 had ever been, loaded with treasure that had no name, that no one had
 ever heard of before. And was, because of that, the richest treasure
 of all.


 We all look alike out here in these big rocket pressure suits, Russell
 thought. No one for God only knew how many of millions of light years
 away could see or care. Still—we might have a chance to live, even
 now, Russell thought—if it weren't for old crazy Dunbar.


 They might have a chance if Alvar and Johnson weren't so damn lacking
 in self-confidence as to put all their trust in that crazed old
 rum-dum. Russell had known now for some time that they were going in
 the wrong direction. No reason for knowing. Just a hunch. And Russell
 was sure his hunch was right.
Russell said. ""Look—look to your left and to your right and behind
 us. Four suns. You guys see those other three suns all around you,
 don't you?""


 ""Sure,"" someone said.


 ""Well, if you'll notice,"" Russell said, ""the one on the left also now
 has a red rim around it. Can't you guys see that?""


 ""Yeah, I see it,"" Alvar said.


 ""So now,"" Johnson said, ""there's two suns with red rims around them.""


 ""We're about in the middle of those four suns aren't we, Dunbar?""
 Russell said.


 ""That's right, boys!"" yelled old Dunbar in that sickeningly optimistic
 voice. Like a hysterical old woman's. ""Just about in the sweet dark
 old middle.""


 ""You're still sure it's the sun up ahead ... that's the only one with
 life on it, Dunbar ... the only one we can live on?"" Russell asked.


 ""That's right! That's right,"" Dunbar yelled. ""That's the only one—and
 it's a paradise. Not just a place to live, boys—but a place you'll
 have trouble believing in because it's like a dream!""


 ""And none of these other three suns have worlds we could live on,
 Dunbar?"" Russell asked. Keep the old duck talking like this and maybe
 Alvar and Johnson would see that he was cracked.


 ""Yeah,"" said Alvar. ""You still say that, Dunbar?""


 ""No life, boys, nothing,"" Dunbar laughed. ""Nothing on these other
 worlds but ashes ... just ashes and iron and dried blood, dried a
 million years or more.""


 ""When in hell were you ever here?"" Johnson said. ""You say you were
 here before. You never said when, or why or anything!""


 ""It was a long time back boys. Don't remember too well, but it was
 when we had an old ship called the DOG STAR that I was here. A pirate
 ship and I was second in command, and we came through this sector.
 That was—hell, it musta' been fifty years ago. I been too many places
 nobody's ever bothered to name or chart, to remember where it is, but
 I been here. I remember those four suns all spotted to form a perfect
 circle from this point, with us squarely in the middle. We explored
 all these suns and the worlds that go round 'em. Trust me, boys, and
 we'll reach the right one. And that one's just like Paradise.""


 ""Paradise is it,"" Russell whispered hoarsely.


 ""Paradise and there we'll be like gods, like Mercuries with wings
 flying on nights of sweet song. These other suns, don't let them
 bother you. They're Jezebels of stars. All painted up in the darkness
 and pretty and waiting and calling and lying! They make you think of
 nice green worlds all running waters and dews and forests thick as
 fleas on a wet dog. But it ain't there, boys. I know this place. I
 been here, long time back.""


 Russell said tightly. ""It'll take us a long time won't it? If it's got
 air we can breath, and water we can drink and shade we can rest
 in—that'll be paradise enough for us. But it'll take a long time
 won't it? And what if it isn't there—what if after all the time we
 spend hoping and getting there—there won't be nothing but ashes and
 cracked clay?""


 ""I know we're going right,"" Dunbar said cheerfully. ""I can tell. Like
 I said—you can tell it because of the red rim around it.""


 ""But the sun on our left, you can see—it's got a red rim too now,""
 Russell said.


 ""Yeah, that's right,"" said Alvar. ""Sometimes I see a red rim around
 the one we're going for, sometimes a red rim around that one on the
 left. Now, sometimes I'm not sure either of them's got a red rim. You
 said that one had a red rim, Dunbar, and I wanted to believe it. So
 now maybe we're all seeing a red rim that was never there.""


 Old Dunbar laughed. The sound brought blood hotly to Russell's face.
 ""We're heading to the right one, boys. Don't doubt me ... I been here.
 We explored all these sun systems. And I remember it all. The second
 planet from that red-rimmed sun. You come down through a soft
 atmosphere, floating like in a dream. You see the green lakes coming
 up through the clouds and the women dancing and the music playing. I
 remember seeing a ship there that brought those women there, a long
 long time before ever I got there. A land like heaven and women like
 angels singing and dancing and laughing with red lips and arms white
 as milk, and soft silky hair floating in the winds.""


 Russell was very sick of the old man's voice. He was at least glad he
 didn't have to look at the old man now. His bald head, his skinny
 bobbing neck, his simpering watery blue eyes. But he still had to
 suffer that immutable babbling, that idiotic cheerfulness ... and
 knowing all the time the old man was crazy, that he was leading them
 wrong.


 I'd break away, go it alone to the right sun, Russell thought—but I'd
 never make it alone. A little while out here alone and I'd be nuttier
 than old Dunbar will ever be, even if he keeps on getting nuttier all
 the time.


 Somewhere, sometime then ... Russell got the idea that the only way
 was to get rid of Dunbar.
You mean to tell us there are people living by that red-rimmed sun,""
 Russell said.


 ""Lost people ... lost ... who knows how long,"" Dunbar said, as the
 four of them hurtled along. ""You never know where you'll find people
 on a world somewhere nobody's ever named or knows about. Places where
 a lost ship's landed and never got up again, or wrecked itself so far
 off the lanes they'll never be found except by accident for millions
 of years. That's what this world is, boys. Must have been a ship load
 of beautiful people, maybe actresses and people like that being hauled
 to some outpost to entertain. They're like angels now, living in a
 land all free from care. Every place you see green forests and fields
 and blue lakes, and at nights there's three moons that come around the
 sky in a thousand different colors. And it never gets cold ... it's
 always spring, always spring, boys, and the music plays all night,
 every night of a long long year....""


 Russell suddenly shouted. ""Keep quiet, Dunbar. Shut up will you?""


 Johnson said. ""Dunbar—how long'll it take us?""


 ""Six months to a year, I'd say,"" Dunbar yelled happily. ""That is—of
 our hereditary time.""


 ""What?"" croaked Alvar.


 Johnson didn't say anything at all.


 Russell screamed at Dunbar, then quieted down. He whispered. ""Six
 months to a year—out here—cooped up in these damn suits. You're
 crazy as hell, Dunbar. Crazy ... crazy! Nobody could stand it. We'll
 all be crazier than you are—""


 ""We'll make it, boys. Trust ole' Dunbar. What's a year when we know
 we're getting to Paradise at the end of it? What's a year out here ...
 it's paradise ain't it, compared with that prison hole we were rotting
 in? We can make it. We have the food concentrates, and all the rest.
 All we need's the will, boys, and we got that. The whole damn Universe
 isn't big enough to kill the will of a human being, boys. I been over
 a whole lot of it, and I know. In the old days—""


 ""The hell with the old days,"" screamed Russell.


 ""Now quiet down, Russ,"" Dunbar said in a kind of dreadful crooning
 whisper. ""You calm down now. You younger fellows—you don't look at
 things the way we used to. Thing is, we got to go straight. People
 trapped like this liable to start meandering. Liable to start losing
 the old will-power.""


 He chuckled.


 ""Yeah,"" said Alvar. ""Someone says maybe we ought to go left, and
 someone says to go right, and someone else says to go in another
 direction. And then someone says maybe they'd better go back the old
 way. An' pretty soon something breaks, or the food runs out, and
 you're a million million miles from someplace you don't care about any
 more because you're dead. All frozen up in space ... preserved like a
 piece of meat in a cold storage locker. And then maybe in a million
 years or so some lousy insect man from Jupiter comes along and finds
 you and takes you away to a museum....""


 ""Shut up!"" Johnson yelled.


 Dunbar laughed. ""Boys, boys, don't get panicky. Keep your heads. Just
 stick to old Dunbar and he'll see you through. I'm always lucky. Only
 one way to go ... an' that's straight ahead to the sun with the
 red-rim around it ... and then we tune in the gravity repellers, and
 coast down, floating and singing down through the clouds to
 paradise.""


 After that they traveled on for what seemed months to Russell, but it
 couldn't have been over a day or two of the kind of time-sense he had
 inherited from Earth.


 Then he saw how the other two stars also were beginning to develop red
 rims. He yelled this fact out to the others. And Alvar said. ""Russ's
 right. That sun to the right, and the one behind us ... now they ALL
 have red rims around them. Dunbar—"" A pause and no awareness of
 motion.


 Dunbar laughed. ""Sure, they all maybe have a touch of red, but it
 isn't the same, boys. I can tell the difference. Trust me—""


 Russell half choked on his words. ""You old goat! With those old eyes
 of yours, you couldn't see your way into a fire!""


 ""Don't get panicky now. Keep your heads. In another year, we'll be
 there—""


 ""God, you gotta' be sure,"" Alvar said. ""I don't mind dyin' out here.
 But after a year of this, and then to get to a world that was only
 ashes, and not able to go any further—""


 ""I always come through, boys. I'm lucky. Angel women will take us to
 their houses on the edges of cool lakes, little houses that sit there
 in the sun like fancy jewels. And we'll walk under colored fountains,
 pretty colored fountains just splashing and splashing like pretty rain
 on our hungry hides. That's worth waiting for.""


 Russell did it before he hardly realized he was killing the old man.
 It was something he had had to do for a long time and that made it
 easy. There was a flash of burning oxygen from inside the suit of
 Dunbar. If he'd aimed right, Russell knew the fire-bullet should have
 pierced Dunbar's back. Now the fire was gone, extinguished
 automatically by units inside the suit. The suit was still inflated,
 self-sealing. Nothing appeared to have changed. The four of them
 hurtling on together, but inside that first suit up there on the front
 of the gravity rope, Dunbar was dead.


 He was dead and his mouth was shut for good.


 Dunbar's last faint cry from inside his suit still rang in Russell's
 ears, and he knew Alvar and Johnson had heard it too. Alvar and
 Johnson both called Dunbar's name a few times. There was no answer.


 ""Russ—you shouldn't have done that,"" Johnson whispered. ""You
 shouldn't have done that to the old man!""


 ""No,"" Alvar said, so low he could barely be heard. ""You shouldn't have
 done it.""


 ""I did it for the three of us,"" Russell said. ""It was either him or us.
 Lies ... lies that was all he had left in his crazy head. Paradise ...
 don't tell me you guys don't see the red rims around all four suns, all
 four suns all around us. Don't tell me you guys didn't know he was batty,
 that you really believed all that stuff he was spouting all the time!""


 ""Maybe he was lying, maybe not,"" Johnson said. ""Now he's dead anyway.""


 ""Maybe he was wrong, crazy, full of lies,"" Alvar said. ""But now he's
 dead.""


 ""How could he see any difference in those four stars?"" Russell said,
 louder.


 ""He thought he was right,"" Alvar said. ""He wanted to take us to
 paradise. He was happy, nothing could stop the old man—but he's dead
 now.""


 He sighed.


 ""He was taking us wrong ... wrong!"" Russell screamed. ""Angels—music
 all night—houses like jewels—and women like angels—""


 ""
Shhhh
,"" said Alvar. It was quiet. How could it be so quiet, Russell
 thought? And up ahead the old man's pressure suit with a corpse inside
 went on ahead, leading the other three at the front of the
 gravity-rope.


 ""Maybe he was wrong,"" Alvar said. ""But now do we know which way is
 right?""
Sometime later, Johnson said, ""We got to decide now. Let's forget the
 old man. Let's forget him and all that's gone and let's start now and
 decide what to do.""


 And Alvar said, ""Guess he was crazy all right, and I guess we trusted
 him because we didn't have the strength to make up our own minds. Why
 does a crazy man's laugh sound so good when you're desperate and don't
 know what to do?""


 ""I always had a feeling we were going wrong,"" Johnson said. ""Anyway,
 it's forgotten, Russ. It's swallowed up in the darkness all around.
 It's never been.""


 Russell said, ""I've had a hunch all along that maybe the old man was
 here before, and that he was right about there being a star here with
 a world we can live on. But I've known we was heading wrong. I've had
 a hunch all along that the right star was the one to the left.""


 ""I don't know,"" Johnson sighed. ""I been feeling partial toward that
 one on the right. What about you, Alvar?""


 ""I always thought we were going straight in the opposite direction
 from what we should, I guess. I always wanted to turn around and go
 back. It won't make over maybe a month's difference. And what does a
 month matter anyway out here—hell there never was any time out here
 until we came along. We make our own time here, and a month don't
 matter to me.""


 Sweat ran down Russell's face. His voice trembled. ""No—that's wrong.
 You're both wrong."" He could see himself going it alone. Going crazy
 because he was alone. He'd have broken away, gone his own direction,
 long ago but for that fear.


 ""How can we tell which of us is right?"" Alvar said. ""It's like
 everything was changing all the time out here. Sometimes I'd swear
 none of those suns had red rims, and at other times—like the old man
 said, they're all pretty and lying and saying nothing, just changing
 all the time. Jezebel stars, the old man said.""


 ""I know I'm right,"" Russell pleaded. ""My hunches always been right.
 My hunch got us out of that prison didn't it? Listen—I tell you it's
 that star to the left—""


 ""The one to the right,"" said Johnson.


 ""We been going away from the right one all the time,"" said Alvar.


 ""We got to stay together,"" said Russell. ""Nobody could spend a year
 out here ... alone....""


 ""Ah ... in another month or so we'd be lousy company anyway,"" Alvar
 said. ""Maybe a guy could get to the point where he'd sleep most of the
 time ... just wake up enough times to give himself another boost with
 the old life-gun.""


 ""We got to face it,"" Johnson said finally. ""We three don't go on
 together any more.""


 ""That's it,"" said Alvar. ""There's three suns that look like they might
 be right seeing as how we all agree the old man was wrong. But we
 believe there is one we can live by, because we all seem to agree that
 the old man might have been right about that. If we stick together,
 the chance is three to one against us. But if each of us makes for one
 star, one of us has a chance to live. Maybe not in paradise like the
 old man said, but a place where we can live. And maybe there'll be
 intelligent life, maybe even a ship, and whoever gets the right star
 can come and help the other two....""


 ""No ... God no...."" Russell whispered over and over. ""None of us can
 ever make it alone....""


 Alvar said, ""We each take the star he likes best. I'll go back the
 other way. Russ, you take the left. And you, Johnson, go to the
 right.""


 Johnson started to laugh. Russell was yelling wildly at them, and
 above his own yelling he could hear Johnson's rising laughter. ""Every
 guy's got a star of his own,"" Johnson said when he stopped laughing.
 ""And we got ours. A nice red-rimmed sun for each of us to call his
 very own.""


 ""Okay,"" Alvar said. ""We cut off the gravity rope, and each to his own
 sun.""


 Now Russell wasn't saying anything.


 ""And the old man,"" Alvar said, ""can keep right on going toward what he
 thought was right. And he'll keep on going. Course he won't be able to
 give himself another boost with the life-gun, but he'll keep going.
 Someday he'll get to that red-rimmed star of his. Out here in space,
 once you're going, you never stop ... and I guess there isn't any
 other body to pull him off his course. And what will time matter to
 old Dunbar? Even less than to us, I guess. He's dead and he won't
 care.""


 ""Ready,"" Johnson said. ""I'll cut off the gravity rope.""


 ""I'm ready,"" Alvar said. ""To go back toward whatever it was I started
 from.""


 ""Ready, Russ?""


 Russell couldn't say anything. He stared at the endless void which now
 he would share with no one. Not even crazy old Dunbar.


 ""All right,"" Johnson said. ""Good-bye.""


 Russell felt the release, felt the sudden inexplicable isolation and
 aloneness even before Alvar and Johnson used their life-guns and shot
 out of sight, Johnson toward the left and Alvar back toward that other
 red-rimmed sun behind them.


 And old Dunbar shooting right on ahead. And all three of them
 dwindling and dwindling and blinking out like little lights.


 Fading, he could hear their voices. ""Each to his own star,"" Johnson
 said. ""On a bee line.""


 ""On a bee line,"" Alvar said.


 Russell used his own life-gun and in a little while he didn't hear
 Alvar or Johnson's voices, nor could he see them. They were thousands
 of miles away, and going further all the time.


 Russell's head fell forward against the front of his helmet, and he
 closed his eyes. ""Maybe,"" he thought, ""I shouldn't have killed the old
 man. Maybe one sun's as good as another....""


 Then he raised his body and looked out into the year of blackness that
 waited for him, stretching away to the red-rimmed sun. Even if he were
 right—he was sure now he'd never make it alone.
The body inside the pressure suit drifted into a low-level orbit
 around the second planet from the sun of its choice, and drifted there
 a long time. A strato-cruiser detected it by chance because of the
 strong concentration of radio-activity that came from it.


 They took the body down to one of the small, quiet towns on the edge
 of one of the many blue lakes where the domed houses were like bright
 joyful jewels. They got the leathery, well-preserved body from the
 pressure suit.


 ""An old man,"" one of them mused. ""A very old man. From one of the lost
 sectors. I wonder how and why he came so very far from his home?""


 ""Wrecked a ship out there, probably,"" one of the others said. ""But he
 managed to get this far. It looks as though a small meteor fragment
 pierced his body. Here. You see?""


 ""Yes,"" another of them said. ""But what amazes me is that this old man
 picked this planet out of all the others. The only one in this entire
 sector that would sustain life.""


 ""Maybe he was just a very lucky old man. Yes ... a man who attains
 such an age was usually lucky. Or at least that is what they say about
 the lost sectors.""


 ""Maybe he knew the way here. Maybe he was here before—sometime.""


 The other shook his head. ""I don't think so. They say some humans from
 that far sector did land here—but that's probably only a myth. And if
 they did, it was well over a thousand years ago.""


 Another said. ""He has a fine face, this old man. A noble face. Whoever
 he is ... wherever he came from, he died bravely and he knew the way,
 though he never reached this haven of the lost alive.""


 ""Nor is it irony that he reached here dead,"" said the Lake Chieftain.
 He had been listening and he stepped forward and raised his arm. ""He
 was old. It is obvious that he fought bravely, that he had great
 courage, and that he knew the way. He will be given a burial suitable
 to his stature, and he will rest here among the brave.


 ""Let the women dance and the music play for this old man. Let the
 trumpets speak, and the rockets fly up. And let flowers be strewn over
 the path above which the women will carry him to rest.""

monkey on his back
Under the cloud of cast-off identities
  
 lay the shape of another man—
  
 was it himself?
Illustrated by DILLON
HE was walking endlessly
 down a long, glass-walled
 corridor. Bright sunlight
 slanted in through one wall, on the
 blue knapsack across his shoulders.
 Who he was, and what he was doing
 here, was clouded. The truth lurked
 in some corner of his consciousness,
 but it was not reached by surface
 awareness.


 The corridor opened at last into
 a large high-domed room, much
 like a railway station or an air terminal.
 He walked straight ahead.


 At the sight of him a man leaning
 negligently against a stone pillar,
 to his right but within vision,
 straightened and barked an order
 to him, “Halt!” He lengthened his
 stride but gave no other sign.


 [p
 136
 ]

 Two men hurried through a
 doorway of a small anteroom to his
 left, calling to him. He turned away
 and began to run.


 Shouts and the sound of charging
 feet came from behind him. He
 cut to the right, running toward the
 escalator to the second floor. Another
 pair of men were hurrying
 down, two steps at a stride. With
 no break in pace he veered into an
 opening beside the escalator.


 At the first turn he saw that the
 aisle merely circled the stairway,
 coming out into the depot again on
 the other side. It was a trap. He
 glanced quickly around him.


 At the rear of the space was a
 row of lockers for traveler use. He
 slipped a coin into a pay slot,
 opened the zipper on his bag and
 pulled out a flat briefcase. It took
 him only a few seconds to push the
 case into the compartment, lock it
 and slide the key along the floor
 beneath the locker.


 There was nothing to do after
 that—except wait.


 The men pursuing him came
 hurtling around the turn in the
 aisle. He kicked his knapsack to
 one side, spreading his feet wide
 with an instinctive motion.


 Until that instant he had intended
 to fight. Now he swiftly
 reassessed the odds. There were
 five of them, he saw. He should be
 able to incapacitate two or three
 and break out. But the fact that
 they had been expecting him meant
 that others would very probably
 be waiting outside. His best course
 now was to sham ignorance. He
 relaxed.


 He offered no resistance as they
 reached him.


 They were not gentle men. A tall
 ruffian, copper-brown face damp
 with perspiration and body oil,
 grabbed him by the jacket and
 slammed him back against the
 lockers. As he shifted his weight
 to keep his footing someone drove
 a fist into his face. He started to
 raise his hands; and a hard flat
 object crashed against the side of
 his skull.


 The starch went out of his legs.
“D
 O you make anything out of
 it?” the psychoanalyst Milton
 Bergstrom, asked.


 John Zarwell shook his head.
 “Did I talk while I was under?”


 “Oh, yes. You were supposed to.
 That way I follow pretty well what
 you’re reenacting.”


 “How does it tie in with what I
 told you before?”


 Bergstrom’s neat-boned, fair-skinned
 face betrayed no emotion
 other than an introspective stillness
 of his normally alert gaze. “I see
 no connection,” he decided, his
 words once again precise and meticulous.
 “We don’t have enough to
 go on. Do you feel able to try another
 comanalysis this afternoon
 yet?”


 “I don’t see why not.” Zarwell
 [p
 137
 ]
 opened the collar of his shirt. The
 day was hot, and the room had no
 air conditioning, still a rare luxury
 on St. Martin’s. The office window
 was open, but it let in no freshness,
 only the mildly rank odor that pervaded
 all the planet’s habitable
 area.


 “Good.” Bergstrom rose. “The
 serum is quite harmless, John.” He
 maintained a professional diversionary
 chatter as he administered
 the drug. “A scopolamine derivative
 that’s been well tested.”


 The floor beneath Zarwell’s feet
 assumed abruptly the near transfluent
 consistency of a damp
 sponge. It rose in a foot-high wave
 and rolled gently toward the far
 wall.


 Bergstrom continued talking,
 with practiced urbanity. “When
 psychiatry was a less exact science,”
 his voice went on, seeming to come
 from a great distance, “a doctor
 had to spend weeks, sometimes
 months or years interviewing a
 patient. If he was skilled enough,
 he could sort the relevancies from
 the vast amount of chaff. We are
 able now, with the help of the
 serum, to confine our discourses to
 matters cogent to the patient’s
 trouble.”


 The floor continued its transmutation,
 and Zarwell sank deep into
 viscous depths. “Lie back and relax.
 Don’t …”


 The words tumbled down from
 above. They faded, were gone.
ZARWELL found himself
standing on a vast plain. There was
 no sky above, and no horizon in the
 distance. He was in a place without
 space or dimension. There was
 nothing here except himself—and
 the gun that he held in his hand.


 A weapon beautiful in its efficient
 simplicity.


 He should know all about the
 instrument, its purpose and workings,
 but he could not bring his
 thoughts into rational focus. His
 forehead creased with his mental
 effort.


 Abruptly the unreality about
 him shifted perspective. He was
 approaching—not walking, but
 merely shortening the space between
 them—the man who held
 the gun. The man who was himself.
 The other “himself” drifted
 nearer also, as though drawn by a
 mutual attraction.


 The man with the gun raised his
 weapon and pressed the trigger.


 With the action the perspective
 shifted again. He was watching the
 face of the man he shot jerk and
 twitch, expand and contract. The
 face was unharmed, yet it was no
 longer the same. No longer his own
 features.


 The stranger face smiled approvingly
 at him.
“O
 DD,” Bergstrom said.
He brought his hands up and joined
 the tips of his fingers against his
 chest. “But it’s another piece in the
 [p
 138
 ]
 jig-saw. In time it will fit into
 place.” He paused. “It means no
 more to you than the first, I suppose?”


 “No,” Zarwell answered.


 He was not a talking man, Bergstrom
 reflected. It was more than
 reticence, however. The man had
 a hard granite core, only partially
 concealed by his present perplexity.
 He was a man who could handle
 himself well in an emergency.


 Bergstrom shrugged, dismissing
 his strayed thoughts. “I expected
 as much. A quite normal first phase
 of treatment.” He straightened a
 paper on his desk. “I think that will
 be enough for today. Twice in one
 sitting is about all we ever try.
 Otherwise some particular episode
 might cause undue mental stress,
 and set up a block.” He glanced
 down at his appointment pad. “Tomorrow
 at two, then?”


 Zarwell grunted acknowledgment
 and pushed himself to his
 feet, apparently unaware that his
 shirt clung damply to his body.
THE sun was still high when
 Zarwell left the analyst’s office.
 The white marble of the city’s
 buildings shimmered in the afternoon
 heat, squat and austere as
 giant tree trunks, pock-marked and
 gray-mottled with windows. Zarwell
 was careful not to rest his hand
 on the flesh searing surface of the
 stone.


 The evening meal hour was approaching
 when he reached the
 Flats, on the way to his apartment.
 The streets of the old section were
 near-deserted. The only sounds he
 heard as he passed were the occasional
 cry of a baby, chronically
 uncomfortable in the day’s heat,
 and the lowing of imported cattle
 waiting in a nearby shed to be
 shipped to the country.


 All St. Martin’s has a distinctive
 smell, as of an arid dried-out
 swamp, with a faint taint of fish.
 But in the Flats the odor changes.
 Here is the smell of factories, warehouses,
 and trading marts; the smell
 of stale cooking drifting from the
 homes of the laborers and lower
 class techmen who live there.


 Zarwell passed a group of
 smaller children playing a desultory
 game of lic-lic for pieces of
 candy and cigarettes. Slowly he
 climbed the stairs of a stone flat.
 He prepared a supper for himself
 and ate it without either enjoyment
 or distaste. He lay down, fully
 clothed, on his bed. The visit to the
 analyst had done nothing to dispel
 his ennui.
[p
 139
 ]



 The next morning when Zarwell
 awoke he lay for a moment, unmoving.
 The feeling was there
 again, like a scene waiting only to
 be gazed at directly to be perceived.
 It was as though a great wisdom
 lay at the edge of understanding.
 If he rested quietly it would
 all come to him. Yet always, when
 his mind lost its sleep-induced
 [p
 140
 ]
 lethargy, the moment of near understanding
 slipped away.


 This morning, however, the sense
 of disorientation did not pass with
 full wakefulness. He achieved no
 understanding, but the strangeness
 did not leave as he sat up.


 He gazed about him. The room
 did not seem to be his own. The
 furnishings, and the clothing he observed
 in a closet, might have belonged
 to a stranger.


 He pulled himself from his blankets,
 his body moving with mechanical
 reaction. The slippers into
 which he put his feet were larger
 than he had expected them to be.
 He walked about the small apartment.
 The place was familiar, but
 only as it would have been if he
 had studied it from blueprints, not
 as though he lived there.


 The feeling was still with him
 when he returned to the psychoanalyst.
THE scene this time was more
 kaleidoscopic, less personal.


 A village was being ravaged.
 Men struggled and died in the
 streets. Zarwell moved among
 them, seldom taking part in the
 individual clashes, yet a moving
 force in the
 conflict
 .


 The background changed. He
 understood that he was on a different
 world.


 Here a city burned. Its resistance
 was nearing its end. Zarwell was
 riding a shaggy pony outside a high
 wall surrounding the stricken metropolis.
 He moved in and joined a
 party of short, bearded men, directing
 them as they battered at the
 wall with a huge log mounted on a
 many-wheeled truck.


 The log broke a breach in the
 concrete and the besiegers charged
 through, carrying back the defenders
 who sought vainly to plug the
 gap. Soon there would be rioting
 in the streets again, plundering and
 killing.


 Zarwell was not the leader of the
 invaders, only a lesser figure in the
 rebellion. But he had played a leading
 part in the planning of the
 strategy that led to the city’s fall.
 The job had been well done.


 Time passed, without visible
 break in the panorama. Now Zarwell
 was fleeing, pursued by the
 same bearded men who had been
 his comrades before. Still he moved
 with the same firm purpose, vigilant,
 resourceful, and well prepared
 for the eventuality that had befallen.
 He made his escape without
 difficulty.


 He alighted from a space ship on
 still another world—another shift
 in time—and the atmosphere of
 conflict engulfed him.


 Weary but resigned he accepted
 it, and did what he had to do …
BERGSTROM was regarding
him with speculative scrutiny.
 “You’ve had quite a past, apparently,”
 he observed.


 [p
 141
 ]

 Zarwell smiled with mild embarrassment.
 “At least in my dreams.”


 “Dreams?” Bergstrom’s eyes
 widened in surprise. “Oh, I beg your
 pardon. I must have forgotten to
 explain. This work is so routine to
 me that sometimes I forget it’s all
 new to a patient. Actually what you
 experienced under the drug were
 not dreams. They were recollections
 of real episodes from your
 past.”


 Zarwell’s expression became
 wary. He watched Bergstrom
 closely. After a minute, however,
 he seemed satisfied, and he let himself
 settle back against the cushion
 of his chair. “I remember nothing
 of what I saw,” he observed.


 “That’s why you’re here, you
 know,” Bergstrom answered. “To
 help you remember.”


 “But everything under the drug
 is so …”


 “Haphazard? That’s true. The
 recall episodes are always purely
 random, with no chronological sequence.
 Our problem will be to reassemble
 them in proper order
 later. Or some particular scene may
 trigger a complete memory return.


 “It is my considered opinion,”
 Bergstrom went on, “that your lost
 memory will turn out to be no ordinary
 amnesia. I believe we will find
 that your mind has been tampered
 with.”


 “Nothing I’ve seen under the
 drug fits into the past I do remember.”


 “That’s what makes me so certain,”
 Bergstrom said confidently.
 “You don’t remember what we
 have shown to be true. Conversely
 then, what you think you remember
 must be false. It must have been
 implanted there. But we can go
 into that later. For today I think
 we have done enough. This episode
 was quite prolonged.”


 “I won’t have any time off again
 until next week end,” Zarwell reminded
 him.


 “That’s right.” Bergstrom
 thought for a moment. “We
 shouldn’t let this hang too long.
 Could you come here after work
 tomorrow?”


 “I suppose I could.”


 “Fine,” Bergstrom said with satisfaction.
 “I’ll admit I’m considerably
 more than casually interested
 in your case by this time.”
A WORK truck picked Zarwell
 up the next morning and he
 rode with a tech crew to the edge of
 the reclam area. Beside the belt
 bringing ocean muck from the converter
 plant at the seashore his
 bulldozer was waiting.


 He took his place behind the
 drive wheel and began working dirt
 down between windbreakers anchored
 in the rock. Along a makeshift
 road into the badlands trucks
 brought crushed lime and phosphorus
 to supplement the ocean
 sediment. The progress of life from
 the sea to the land was a mechanical
 [p
 142
 ]
 process of this growing world.


 Nearly two hundred years ago,
 when Earth established a colony on
 St. Martin’s, the land surface of the
 planet had been barren. Only its
 seas thrived with animal and vegetable
 life. The necessary machinery
 and technicians had been supplied
 by Earth, and the long struggle began
 to fit the world for human
 needs. When Zarwell arrived, six
 months before, the vitalized area
 already extended three hundred
 miles along the coast, and sixty
 miles inland. And every day the
 progress continued. A large percentage
 of the energy and resources
 of the world were devoted to that
 essential expansion.


 The reclam crews filled and
 sodded the sterile rock, planted
 binding grasses, grain and trees, and
 diverted rivers to keep it fertile.
 When there were no rivers to divert
 they blasted out springs and lakes
 in the foothills to make their own.
 Biologists developed the necessary
 germ and insect life from what they
 found in the sea. Where that failed,
 they imported microorganisms
 from Earth.


 Three rubber-tracked crawlers
 picked their way down from the
 mountains until they joined the
 road passing the belt. They were
 loaded with ore that would be
 smelted into metal for depleted
 Earth, or for other colonies short
 of minerals. It was St. Martin’s only
 export thus far.


 Zarwell pulled his sun helmet
 lower, to better guard his hot, dry
 features. The wind blew continuously
 on St. Martin’s, but it furnished
 small relief from the heat.
 After its three-thousand-mile journey
 across scorched sterile rock, it
 sucked the moisture from a man’s
 body, bringing a membrane-shrinking
 dryness to the nostrils as it was
 breathed in. With it came also the
 cloying taste of limestone in a
 worker’s mouth.


 Zarwell gazed idly about at the
 other laborers. Fully three-quarters
 of them were beri-rabza ridden. A
 cure for the skin fungus had not
 yet been found; the men’s faces
 and hands were scabbed and red.
 The colony had grown to near self-sufficiency,
 would soon have a moderate
 prosperity, yet they still
 lacked adequate medical and research
 facilities.


 Not all the world’s citizens were
 content.


 Bergstrom was waiting in his office
 when Zarwell arrived that
 evening.
HE was lying motionless on a
 hard cot, with his eyes closed,
 yet with his every sense sharply
 quickened. Tentatively he tightened
 small muscles in his arms and
 legs. Across his wrists and thighs
 he felt straps binding him to the
 cot.


 “So that’s our big, bad man,” a
 coarse voice above him observed
 [p
 143
 ]
 caustically. “He doesn’t look so
 tough now, does he?”


 “It might have been better to
 kill him right away,” a second, less
 confident voice said. “It’s supposed
 to be impossible to hold him.”


 “Don’t be stupid. We just do
 what we’re told. We’ll hold him.”


 “What do you think they’ll do
 with him?”


 “Execute him, I suppose,” the
 harsh voice said matter-of-factly.
 “They’re probably just curious to
 see what he looks like first. They’ll
 be disappointed.”


 Zarwell opened his eyes a slit to
 observe his surroundings.


 It was a mistake. “He’s out of
 it,” the first speaker said, and Zarwell
 allowed his eyes to open fully.


 The voice, he saw, belonged to
 the big man who had bruised him
 against the locker at the spaceport.
 Irrelevantly he wondered how he
 knew now that it had been a spaceport.


 His captor’s broad face jeered
 down at Zarwell. “Have a good
 sleep?” he asked with mock solicitude.
 Zarwell did not deign to acknowledge
 that he heard.


 The big man turned. “You can
 tell the Chief he’s awake,” he said.
 Zarwell followed his gaze to where
 a younger man, with a blond lock of
 hair on his forehead, stood behind
 him. The youth nodded and went
 out, while the other pulled a chair
 up to the side of Zarwell’s cot.


 While their attention was away
 from him Zarwell had unobtrusively
 loosened his bonds as much as
 possible with arm leverage. As the
 big man drew his chair nearer, he
 made the hand farthest from him
 tight and compact and worked it
 free of the leather loop. He waited.


 The big man belched. “You’re
 supposed to be great stuff in a situation
 like this,” he said, his smoke-tan
 face splitting in a grin that revealed
 large square teeth. “How
 about giving me a sample?”


 “You’re a yellow-livered bastard,”
 Zarwell told him.


 The grin faded from the oily face
 as the man stood up. He leaned over
 the cot—and Zarwell’s left hand
 shot up and locked about his throat,
 joined almost immediately by the
 right.


 The man’s mouth opened and he
 tried to yell as he threw himself
 frantically backward. He clawed at
 the hands about his neck. When
 that failed to break the grip he suddenly
 reversed his weight and
 drove his fist at Zarwell’s head.


 Zarwell pulled the struggling
 body down against his chest and
 held it there until all agitated
 movement ceased. He sat up then,
 letting the body slide to the floor.


 The straps about his thighs came
 loose with little effort.
THE analyst dabbed at his upper
 lip with a handkerchief. “The
 episodes are beginning to tie together,”
 he said, with an attempt at
 [p
 144
 ]
 nonchalance. “The next couple
 should do it.”


 Zarwell did not answer. His
 memory seemed on the point of
 complete return, and he sat quietly,
 hopefully. However, nothing more
 came and he returned his attention
 to his more immediate problem.


 Opening a button on his shirt, he
 pulled back a strip of plastic cloth
 just below his rib cage and took
 out a small flat pistol. He held it
 in the palm of his hand. He knew
 now why he always carried it.


 Bergstrom had his bad moment.
 “You’re not going to …” he began
 at the sight of the gun. He tried
 again. “You must be joking.”


 “I have very little sense of humor,”
 Zarwell corrected him.


 “You’d be foolish!”


 Bergstrom obviously realized
 how close he was to death. Yet
 surprisingly, after the first start,
 he showed little fear. Zarwell had
 thought the man a bit soft, too
 adjusted to a life of ease and some
 prestige to meet danger calmly.
 Curiosity restrained his trigger finger.


 “Why would I be foolish?” he
 asked. “Your Meninger oath of inviolable
 confidence?”


 Bergstrom shook his head. “I
 know it’s been broken before. But
 you need me. You’re not through,
 you know. If you killed me you’d
 still have to trust some other
 analyst.”


 “Is that the best you can do?”


 “No.” Bergstrom was angry now.
 “But use that logical mind you’re
 supposed to have! Scenes before
 this have shown what kind of man
 you are. Just because this last happened
 here on St. Martin’s makes
 little difference. If I was going to
 turn you in to the police, I’d have
 done it before this.”


 Zarwell debated with himself the
 truth of what the other had said.
 “Why didn’t you turn me in?” he
 asked.


 “Because you’re no mad-dog
 killer!” Now that the crisis seemed
 to be past, Bergstrom spoke more
 calmly, even allowed himself to
 relax. “You’re still pretty much in
 the fog about yourself. I read more
 in those comanalyses than you did.
 I even know who you are!”


 Zarwell’s eyebrows raised.


 “Who am I?” he asked, very interested
 now. Without attention he
 put his pistol away in a trouser
 pocket.


 Bergstrom brushed the question
 aside with one hand. “Your name
 makes little difference. You’ve used
 many. But you are an idealist. Your
 killings were necessary to bring
 justice to the places you visited. By
 now you’re almost a legend among
 the human worlds. I’d like to talk
 more with you on that later.”


 While Zarwell considered, Bergstrom
 pressed his advantage. “One
 more scene might do it,” he said.
 “Should we try again—if you trust
 me, that is?”


 [p
 145
 ]

 Zarwell made his decision quickly.
 “Go ahead,” he answered.
ALL Zarwell’s attention seemed
 on the cigar he lit as he rode
 down the escalator, but he surveyed
 the terminal carefully over the rim
 of his hand. He spied no suspicious
 loungers.


 Behind the escalator he groped
 along the floor beneath the lockers
 until he found his key. The briefcase
 was under his arm a minute
 later.


 In the basement lave he put a
 coin in the pay slot of a private
 compartment and went in.


 As he zipped open the briefcase
 he surveyed his features in the mirror.
 A small muscle at the corner of
 one eye twitched spasmodically.
 One cheek wore a frozen quarter
 smile. Thirty-six hours under the
 paralysis was longer than advisable.
 The muscles should be rested at
 least every twenty hours.


 Fortunately his natural features
 would serve as an adequate disguise
 now.


 He adjusted the ring setting on
 the pistol-shaped instrument that
 he took from his case, and carefully
 rayed several small areas of
 his face, loosening muscles that had
 been tight too long. He sighed
 gratefully when he finished, massaging
 his cheeks and forehead with
 considerable pleasure. Another
 glance in the mirror satisfied him
 with the changes that had been
 made. He turned to his briefcase
 again and exchanged the gun for
 a small syringe, which he pushed
 into a trouser pocket, and a single-edged
 razor blade.


 Removing his fiber-cloth jacket
 he slashed it into strips with the
 razor blade and flushed it down the
 disposal bowl. With the sleeves of
 his blouse rolled up he had the
 appearance of a typical workman
 as he strolled from the compartment.


 Back at the locker he replaced
 the briefcase and, with a wad of
 gum, glued the key to the bottom
 of the locker frame.


 One step more. Taking the syringe
 from his pocket, he plunged
 the needle into his forearm and
 tossed the instrument down a
 waste chute. He took three more
 steps and paused uncertainly.


 When he looked about him it
 was with the expression of a man
 waking from a vivid dream.
“Q
 UITE ingenious,” Graves
 murmured admiringly. “You
 had your mind already preconditioned
 for the shot. But why would
 you deliberately give yourself amnesia?”


 “What better disguise than to
 believe the part you’re playing?”


 “A good man must have done
 that job on your mind,” Bergstrom
 commented. “I’d have hesitated to
 try it myself. It must have taken a
 lot of trust on your part.”


 [p
 146
 ]

 “Trust and money,” Zarwell said
 drily.


 “Your memory’s back then?”


 Zarwell nodded.


 “I’m glad to hear that,” Bergstrom
 assured him. “Now that
 you’re well again I’d like to introduce
 you to a man named Vernon
 Johnson. This world …”


 Zarwell stopped him with an upraised
 hand. “Good God, man, can’t
 you see the reason for all this? I’m
 tired. I’m trying to quit.”


 “Quit?” Bergstrom did not quite
 follow him.


 “It started on my home colony,”
 Zarwell explained listlessly. “A
 gang of hoods had taken over the
 government. I helped organize a
 movement to get them out. There
 was some bloodshed, but it went
 quite well. Several months later an
 unofficial envoy from another
 world asked several of us to give
 them a hand on the same kind of
 job. The political conditions there
 were rotten. We went with him.
 Again we were successful. It seems
 I have a kind of genius for that
 sort of thing.”


 He stretched out his legs and regarded
 them thoughtfully. “I
 learned then the truth of Russell’s
 saying: ‘When the oppressed win
 their freedom they are as oppressive
 as their former masters.’ When
 they went bad, I opposed them.
 This time I failed. But I escaped
 again. I have quite a talent for that
 also.


 “I’m not a professional do-gooder.”
 Zarwell’s tone appealed
 to Bergstrom for understanding. “I
 have only a normal man’s indignation
 at injustice. And now I’ve done
 my share. Yet, wherever I go, the
 word eventually gets out, and I’m
 right back in a fight again. It’s like
 the proverbial monkey on my back.
 I can’t get rid of it.”


 He rose. “That disguise and
 memory planting were supposed to
 get me out of it. I should have
 known it wouldn’t work. But this
 time I’m not going to be drawn
 back in! You and your Vernon
 Johnson can do your own revolting.
 I’m through!”


 Bergstrom did not argue as he
 left.
RESTLESSNESS drove Zarwell
 from his flat the next day—a
 legal holiday on St. Martin’s. At
 a railed-off lot he stopped and loitered
 in the shadow of an adjacent
 building watching workmen drilling
 an excavation for a new structure.


 When a man strolled to his side
 and stood watching the workmen,
 he was not surprised. He waited for
 the other to speak.


 “I’d like to talk to you, if you
 can spare a few minutes,” the
 stranger said.


 Zarwell turned and studied the
 man without answering. He was
 medium tall, with the body of an
 athlete, though perhaps ten years
 [p
 147
 ]
 beyond the age of sports. He had
 a manner of contained energy.
 “You’re Johnson?” he asked.


 The man nodded.


 Zarwell tried to feel the anger he
 wanted to feel, but somehow it
 would not come. “We have nothing
 to talk about,” was the best he
 could manage.


 “Then will you just listen? After,
 I’ll leave—if you tell me to.”


 Against his will he found himself
 liking the man, and wanting at least
 to be courteous. He inclined his
 head toward a curb wastebox with
 a flat top. “Should we sit?”


 Johnson smiled agreeably and
 they walked over to the box and
 sat down.


 “When this colony was first
 founded,” Johnson began without
 preamble, “the administrative body
 was a governor, and a council of
 twelve. Their successors were to
 be elected biennially. At first they
 were. Then things changed. We
 haven’t had an election now in the
 last twenty-three years. St. Martin’s
 is beginning to prosper. Yet
 the only ones receiving the benefits
 are the rulers. The citizens work
 twelve hours a day. They are poorly
 housed
 , poorly fed, poorly clothed.
 They …”


 Zarwell found himself not listening
 as Johnson’s voice went on. The
 story was always the same. But why
 did they always try to drag him into
 their troubles?


 Why hadn’t he chosen some
 other world on which to hide?


 The last question prompted a
 new thought. Just why had he
 chosen St. Martin’s? Was it only a
 coincidence? Or had he,
 subconsciously
 at least, picked this particular
 world? He had always
 considered himself the unwilling
 subject of glib persuaders … but
 mightn’t some inner compulsion of
 his own have put the monkey on his
 back?


 “… and we need your help.”
 Johnson had finished his speech.


 Zarwell gazed up at the bright
 sky. He pulled in a long breath,
 and let it out in a sigh.


 “What are your plans so far?”
 he asked wearily.

The large horse plodded slowly over the shifting sand.


 The rider was of medium size, with huge, strong hands and seemingly
 hollow eyes. Strange eyes, alive and aflame. They had no place in
 the dust-caked, tired body, yet there they were, seeking, always
 seeking—searching the clear horizon, and never seeming to find what
 they sought.
The horse moved faster now. They were nearing a river; the water would
 be welcome on tired bodies and dry throats. He spurred his horse,
 and when they reached the water's edge, he dismounted and unsaddled
 the horse. Then both man and horse plunged headlong into the waiting
 torrent, deep into the cool embrace of the clear liquid. They soaked it
 into their pores and drank deeply of it, feeling life going once more
 through their veins. Satisfied, they lifted themselves from the water,
 and the man lay down on the yellow sand of the river bank to sleep.


 When he awoke, the sun was almost setting. The bright shafts of red
 light spilled across the sky, making the mountains silent scarlet
 shadows on the face of the rippling water. Quickly he gathered
 driftwood, and built a small fire. From his pack he removed some of
 the coffee he had found in one of the ruined cities. He brought water
 from the river in the battered coffee-pot he had salvaged, and while he
 waited for it to boil, he went to his horse, Conqueror, stroking his
 mane and whispering in his ear. Then he led him silently to a grassy
 slope where he hobbled him and left him for the night.


 In the fading light, he ate the hard beef jerky and drank the scalding
 coffee. Refreshed and momentarily content, he sat staring into the
 dying fire, seeing the bright glowing coals as living fingers clutching
 at the wood in consuming embrace, taking all and returning nothing but
 ashes.


 Slowly his eyelids yielded. His body sagged, and blood seemed to fill
 his brain, bathing it in a gentle, warm flood.


 He slept. His brain slept.


 But the portion of his brain called memory stirred. It was all alone;
 all else was at rest. Images began to appear, drawn from inexhaustible
 files, wherein are kept all thoughts, past, present, and future....
It was the night before he was to go overseas. World War III had been
 declared, and he had enlisted, receiving his old rank of captain. He
 was with his wife in the living room of their home. They had put the
 children to bed—their sons—and now sat on the couch, watching the
 blazing fire. It was then that he had showed it to her.


 ""I've got something to tell you, and something to show you.""


 He had removed the box from his pocket and opened it. And heard her cry
 of surprised joy.


 ""Oh, a ring, and it's a diamond, too!"" she cried in her rich, happy
 voice which always seemed to send a thrill through his body.


 ""It's for you; so long as you wear it, I'll come back, even from the
 dead, if need be. Read the inscription.""


 She held the ring up to the light and read aloud, ""It is forever.""


 Then she had slipped the ring on her finger and her arms around him.
 He held her very close, feeling the warmth from her body flowing into
 his and making him oblivious to everything except that she was there in
 his arms and that he was sinking deep, deep into a familiar sea, where
 he had been many times before but each time found something new and
 unexplored, some vastly different emotion he could never quite explain.


 ""Wait!"" she cried. ""I've something for you, too.""


 She took off the locket she wore about her neck and held it up to the
 shimmering light, letting it spin at the end of its chain. It caught
 the shadows of the fire and reflected them, greatly magnified, over the
 room. It was in the shape of a star, encrusted with emeralds, with one
 large ruby in the center. When he opened it, he found a picture of her
 in one side, and in the other a picture of the children. He took her in
 his arms again, and loosened her long, black hair, burying his face in
 it for a moment. Then he kissed her, and instantly was drawn down into
 the abyss which seemed to have no beginning or any end.


 The next morning had been bleak and gray. The mist clung to the wet,
 sodden ground, and the air was heavy in his lungs. He had driven off
 in the jeep the army had sent for him, watching her there on the porch
 until the mist swirled around her feet and she ran back into the house
 and slammed the door. His cold fingers found the locket, making a
 little bulge under his uniform, and the touch of it seemed to warm the
 blood in his veins.


 Three days later they had landed in Spain, merged with another
 division, then crossed the Pyrenees into France, and finally to Paris
 where the fighting had begun. Already the city was a silent graveyard,
 littered with the rubble of towers and cathedrals which had once been
 great.


 Three years later they were on the road to Moscow. Over a thousand
 miles lay behind, a dead man on every foot of those miles. Yet victory
 was near. The Russians had not yet used the H-bomb; the threat of
 annihilation by the retaliation forces had been too great.


 He had done well in the war, and had been decorated many times for
 bravery in action. Now he felt the victory that seemed to be in the
 air, and he had wished it would come quickly, so that he might return
 to her. Home. The very feel of the word was everything a battle-weary
 soldier needed to make him fight harder and live longer.


 Suddenly he had become aware of a droning, wooshing sound above him. It
 grew louder and louder until he knew what it was.


 ""Heavy bombers!"" The alarm had sounded, and the men had headed for
 their foxholes.


 But the planes had passed over, the sun glinting on their bellies,
 reflecting a blinding light. They were bound for bigger, more important
 targets. When the all-clear had sounded, the men clambered from their
 shelters. An icy wind swept the field, bringing with it clouds which
 covered the sun. A strange fear had gripped him then....


 Across the Atlantic, over the pole, via Alaska, the great bombers
 flew. In cities, great and small, the air raid sirens sounded, high
 screaming noises which had jarred the people from sleep in time to die.
 The defending planes roared into the sky to intercept the on-rushing
 bombers. The horrendous battle split the universe. Many bombers fell,
 victims of fanatical suicide planes, or of missiles that streaked
 across the sky which none could escape.


 But too many bombers got through, dropping their deadly cargo upon the
 helpless cities. And not all the prayers or entreaties to any God had
 stopped their carnage. First there had been the red flashes that melted
 buildings into molten streams, and then the great triple-mushroom cloud
 filled with the poisonous gases that the wind swept away to other
 cities, where men had not died quickly and mercifully, but had rotted
 away, leaving shreds of putrid flesh behind to mark the places where
 they had crawled.


 The retaliatory forces had roared away to bomb the Russian cities. Few,
 if any, had returned. Too much blood and life were on their hands.
 Those who had remained alive had found a resting place on the crown
 of some distant mountain. Others had preferred the silent peaceful
 sea, where flesh stayed not long on bones, and only darting fishes and
 merciful beams of filtered light found their aluminum coffins.


 The war had ended.


 To no avail. Neither side had won. Most of the cities and the majority
 of the population of both countries had been destroyed. Even their
 governments had vanished, leaving a silent nothingness. The armies that
 remained were without leaders, without sources of supplies, save what
 they could forage and beg from an unfriendly people.


 They were alone now, a group of tired, battered men, for whom life held
 nothing. Their families had long since died, their bodies turned to
 dust, their spirits fled on the winds to a new world.


 Yet these remnants of an army must return—or at least try. Their
 exodus was just beginning. Somehow he had managed to hold together the
 few men left from his force. He had always nourished the hope that
 she might still be alive. And now that the war was over he had to
 return—had to know whether she was still waiting for him.


 They had started the long trek. Throughout Europe anarchy reigned. He
 and his men were alone. All they could do now was fight. Finally they
 reached the seaport city of Calais. With what few men he had left, he
 had commandeered a small yacht, and they had taken to the sea.


 After months of storms and bad luck, they had been shipwrecked
 somewhere off the coast of Mexico. He had managed to swim ashore,
 and had been found by a fisherman's family. Many months he had spent
 swimming and fishing, recovering his strength, inquiring about the
 United States. The Mexicans had spoken with fear of the land across the
 Rio Grande. All its great cities had been destroyed, and those that had
 been only partially destroyed were devoid of people. The land across
 the Rio Grande had become a land of shadows. The winds were poisoned,
 and the few people who might have survived, were crazed and maimed by
 the blasts. Few men had dared cross the Rio Grande into ""El Mundo gris
 de Noviembre""—the November world. Those who had, had never returned.


 In time he had traveled north until he reached the Rio Grande. He had
 waded into the muddy waters and somehow landed on the American side. In
 the November world.


 It was rightly called. The deserts were long. All plant life had died,
 leaving to those once great fertile stretches, nothing but the sad,
 temporal beauty that comes with death. No people had he seen. Only the
 ruins of what had once been their cities. He had walked through them,
 and all that he had seen were the small mutant rodents, and all that he
 had heard was the occasional swish of the wind as it whisked along what
 might have been dead leaves, but wasn't.


 He had been on the trail for a long time. His food was nearly
 exhausted. The mountains were just beginning, and he hoped to find food
 there. He had not found food, but his luck had been with him. He had
 found a horse. Not a normal horse, but a mutation. It was almost twice
 as large as a regular horse. Its skin seemed to shimmer and was like
 glassy steel to the touch. From the center of its forehead grew a horn,
 straight out, as the horn of a unicorn. But most startling of all were
 the animal's eyes which seemed to speak—a silent mental speech, which
 he could understand. The horse had looked up as he approached it and
 seemed to say: ""Follow me.""


 And he had followed. Over a mountain, until they came to a pass, and
 finally to a narrow path which led to an old cabin. He had found it
 empty, but there were cans of food and a rifle and many shells. He had
 remained there a long time—how long he could not tell, for he could
 only measure time by the cycles of the sun and the moon. Finally he
 had taken the horse, the rifle and what food was left, and once again
 started the long journey home.


 The farther north he went, the more life seemed to have survived. He
 had seen great herds of horses like his own, stampeding across the
 plains, and strange birds which he could not identify. Yet he had seen
 no human beings.


 But he knew he was closer now. Closer to home. He recognized the land.
 How, he did not know, for it was much changed. A sensing, perhaps, of
 what it had once been. He could not be more than two days' ride away.
 Once he was through this desert, he would find her, he would be with
 her once again; all would be well, and his long journey would be over.
The images faded. Even memory slept in a flow of warm blood. Body and
 mind slept into the shadows of the dawn.


 He awoke and stretched the cramped muscles of his body. At the edge of
 the water he removed his clothes and stared at himself in the rippling
 mirror. His muscles were lean and hard, evenly placed throughout the
 length of his frame. A deep ridge ran down the length of his torso,
 separating the muscles, making the chest broad. Well satisfied with his
 body, he plunged into the cold water, deep down, until he thought his
 lungs would burst; then swiftly returned to the clean air, tingling in
 every pore. He dried himself and dressed. Conqueror was eating the long
 grass near the stream. Quickly he saddled him. No time for breakfast.
 He would ride all day and the next night. And he would be home.


 Still northward. The hours crawled slower than a dying man. The sun
 was a torch that pierced his skin, seeming to melt his bones into a
 burning stream within his body. But day at last gave way to night, and
 the sun to the moon. The torch became a white pock-marked goddess, with
 streaming hair called stars.


 In the moonlight he had not seen the crater until he was at its
 very edge. Even then he might not have seen it had not the horse
 stopped suddenly. The wind swirled through its vast emptiness,
 slapping his face with dusty hands. For a moment he thought he heard
 voices—mournful, murmuring voices, echoing up from the misty depths.
 He turned quickly away and did not look back.


 Night paled into day; day burned into night.


 There were clouds in the sky now, and a gentle wind caressed the sweat
 from his tired body. He stopped. There it was! Barely discernible
 through the moonlight, he saw it. Home.


 Quickly he dismounted and ran. Now he could see a small light in the
 window, and he knew they were there. His breath came in hard ragged
 gulps. At the window he peered in, and as his eyes became accustomed
 to the inner gloom, he saw how bare the room was. No matter. Now that
 he was home he would build new furniture, and the house would be even
 better than it had been before.


 Then he saw her.


 She was sitting motionless in a straight wooden chair beside the
 fireplace, the feeble light cast by the embers veiling her in mauve
 shadows. He waited, wondering if she were.... Presently she stirred
 like a restless child in sleep, then moved from the chair to the pile
 of wood near the hearth, and replenished the fire. The wood caught
 quickly, sending up long tongues of flame, and forming a bright pool of
 light around her.


 His blood froze. The creature illuminated by the firelight was a
 monster. Large greasy scales covered its face and arms, and there was
 no hair on its head. Its gums were toothless cavities in a sunken,
 mumbling mouth. The eyes, turned momentarily toward the window, were
 empty of life.


 ""No, no!"" he cried soundlessly.


 This was not his house. In his delirium he had only imagined he had
 found it. He had been searching so long. He would go on searching.
 He was turning wearily away from the window when the movement of the
 creature beside the fire held his attention. It had taken a ring from
 one skeleton-like finger and stood, turning the ring slowly as if
 trying to decipher some inscription inside it.


 He knew then. He had come home.


 Slowly he moved toward the door. A great weakness was upon him. His
 feet were stones, reluctant to leave the earth. His body was a weed,
 shriveled by thirst. He grasped the doorknob and clung to it, looking
 up at the night sky and trying to draw strength from the wind that
 passed over him. It was no use. There was no strength. Only fear—a
 kind of fear he had never known.


 He fumbled at his throat, his fingers crawling like cold worms around
 his neck until he found the locket and the clasp which had held it
 safely through endless nightmare days and nights. He slipped the clasp
 and the locket fell into his waiting hand. As one in a dream, he opened
 it, and stared at the pictures, now in the dim moonlight no longer
 faces of those he loved, but grey ghosts from the past. Even the ruby
 had lost its glow. What had once been living fire was now a dull glob
 of darkness.


 ""Nothing is forever!"" He thought he had shouted the words, but only a
 thin sound, the sound of leaves ruffled by the wind, came back to him.


 He closed the locket and fastened the clasp, and hung it on the
 doorknob. It moved slowly in the wind, back and forth, like a pendulum.
 ""Forever—forever. Only death is forever."" He could have sworn he heard
 the words.


 He ran. Away from the house. To the large horse with a horn in the
 center of its forehead, like a unicorn. Once in the saddle, the spurt
 of strength left him. His shoulders slumped, his head dropped onto his
 chest.


 Conqueror trotted away, the sound of his hooves echoing hollowly in the
 vast emptiness.

 Me? Oh,
I'm A Stranger
 
Here Myself
By MACK REYNOLDS
The
 Place de France is the
 town's hub. It marks the end
 of Boulevard Pasteur, the main
 drag of the westernized part of
 the city, and the beginning of
 Rue de la Liberté, which leads
 down to the Grand Socco and
 the medina. In a three-minute
 walk from the Place de France
 you can go from an ultra-modern,
 California-like resort to the
 Baghdad of Harun al-Rashid.


 It's quite a town, Tangier.


 King-size sidewalk cafes occupy
 three of the strategic
 corners on the Place de France.
 The Cafe de Paris serves the
 best draft beer in town, gets all
 the better custom, and has three
 shoeshine boys attached to the
 establishment. You can sit of a
 sunny morning and read the
 Paris edition of the New York
Herald Tribune
while getting
 your shoes done up like mirrors
 for thirty Moroccan francs
 which comes to about five cents
 at current exchange.


 You can sit there, after the
 paper's read, sip your expresso
 and watch the people go by.


 Tangier is possibly the most
 cosmopolitan city in the world.
 In native costume you'll see
 Berber and Rif, Arab and Blue
 Man, and occasionally a Senegalese
 from further south. In
 European dress you'll see Japs
 and Chinese, Hindus and Turks,
 Levantines and Filipinos, North
 Americans and South Americans,
 and, of course, even Europeans—from
 both sides of the
 Curtain.


 In Tangier you'll find some of
 the world's poorest and some of
 the richest. The poorest will try
 to sell you anything from a
 shoeshine to their not very lily-white
 bodies, and the richest will
 avoid your eyes, afraid
you
might try to sell them something.


 In spite of recent changes, the
 town still has its unique qualities.
 As a result of them the permanent
 population includes
 smugglers and black-marketeers,
 fugitives from justice and international
 con men, espionage
 and counter-espionage agents,
 homosexuals, nymphomaniacs, alcoholics,
 drug addicts, displaced
 persons, ex-royalty, and subversives
 of every flavor. Local law
 limits the activities of few of
 these.


 Like I said, it's quite a town.
I looked up from my
Herald
 Tribune
and said, ""Hello, Paul.
 Anything new cooking?""


 He sank into the chair opposite
 me and looked around for
 the waiter. The tables were all
 crowded and since mine was a
 face he recognized, he assumed
 he was welcome to intrude. It was
 more or less standard procedure
 at the Cafe de Paris. It wasn't
 a place to go if you wanted to
 be alone.


 Paul said, ""How are you,
 Rupert? Haven't seen you for
 donkey's years.""


 The waiter came along and
 Paul ordered a glass of beer.
 Paul was an easy-going, sallow-faced
 little man. I vaguely remembered
 somebody saying he
 was from Liverpool and in
 exports.


 ""What's in the newspaper?""
 he said, disinterestedly.


 ""Pogo and Albert are going
 to fight a duel,"" I told him, ""and
 Lil Abner is becoming a rock'n'roll
 singer.""


 He grunted.


 ""Oh,"" I said, ""the intellectual
 type."" I scanned the front page.
 ""The Russkies have put up
 another manned satellite.""


 ""They have, eh? How big?""


 ""Several times bigger than
 anything we Americans have.""


 The beer came and looked
 good, so I ordered a glass too.


 Paul said, ""What ever happened
 to those poxy flying
 saucers?""


 ""What flying saucers?""


 A French girl went by with a
 poodle so finely clipped as to look
 as though it'd been shaven. The
 girl was in the latest from
 Paris. Every pore in place. We
 both looked after her.


 ""You know, what everybody
 was seeing a few years ago. It's
 too bad one of these bloody manned
 satellites wasn't up then.
 Maybe they would've seen one.""


 ""That's an idea,"" I said.


 We didn't say anything else for
 a while and I began to wonder
 if I could go back to my paper
 without rubbing him the wrong
 way. I didn't know Paul very
 well, but, for that matter, it's
 comparatively seldom you ever
 get to know anybody very well
 in Tangier. Largely, cards are
 played close to the chest.
My beer came and a plate of
 tapas for us both. Tapas at the
 Cafe de Paris are apt to be
 potato salad, a few anchovies,
 olives, and possibly some cheese.
 Free lunch, they used to call it
 in the States.


 Just to say something, I said,
 ""Where do you think they came
 from?"" And when he looked
 blank, I added, ""The Flying
 Saucers.""


 He grinned. ""From Mars or
 Venus, or someplace.""


 ""Ummmm,"" I said. ""Too bad
 none of them ever crashed, or
 landed on the Yale football field
 and said
Take me to your cheerleader
,
 or something.""


 Paul yawned and said, ""That
 was always the trouble with those
 crackpot blokes' explanations of
 them. If they were aliens from
 space, then why not show themselves?""


 I ate one of the potato chips.
 It'd been cooked in rancid olive
 oil.


 I said, ""Oh, there are various
 answers to that one. We could
 probably sit around here and
 think of two or three that made
 sense.""


 Paul was mildly interested.
 ""Like what?""


 ""Well, hell, suppose for instance
 there's this big Galactic League
 of civilized planets. But it's restricted,
 see. You're not eligible
 for membership until you, well,
 say until you've developed space
 flight. Then you're invited into
 the club. Meanwhile, they send
 secret missions down from time
 to time to keep an eye on your
 progress.""


 Paul grinned at me. ""I see you
 read the same poxy stuff I do.""


 A Moorish girl went by dressed
 in a neatly tailored gray
 jellaba, European style high-heeled
 shoes, and a pinkish silk
 veil so transparent that you
 could see she wore lipstick. Very
 provocative, dark eyes can be
 over a veil. We both looked
 after her.


 I said, ""Or, here's another
 one. Suppose you have a very
 advanced civilization on, say,
 Mars.""


 ""Not Mars. No air, and too
 bloody dry to support life.""


 ""Don't interrupt, please,"" I
 said with mock severity. ""This
 is a very old civilization and as
 the planet began to lose its
 water and air, it withdrew underground.
 Uses hydroponics and
 so forth, husbands its water and
 air. Isn't that what we'd do, in
 a few million years, if Earth lost
 its water and air?""


 ""I suppose so,"" he said. ""Anyway,
 what about them?""


 ""Well, they observe how man
 is going through a scientific
 boom, an industrial boom, a
 population boom. A boom, period.
 Any day now he's going to have
 practical space ships. Meanwhile,
 he's also got the H-Bomb and
 the way he beats the drums on
 both sides of the Curtain, he's
 not against using it, if he could
 get away with it.""


 Paul said, ""I got it. So they're
 scared and are keeping an eye on
 us. That's an old one. I've read
 that a dozen times, dished up
 different.""


 I shifted my shoulders. ""Well,
 it's one possibility.""


 ""I got a better one. How's
 this. There's this alien life form
 that's way ahead of us. Their
 civilization is so old that they
 don't have any records of when
 it began and how it was in the
 early days. They've gone beyond
 things like wars and depressions
 and revolutions, and greed for
 power or any of these things
 giving us a bad time here on
 Earth. They're all like scholars,
 get it? And some of them are
 pretty jolly well taken by Earth,
 especially the way we are right
 now, with all the problems, get
 it? Things developing so fast we
 don't know where we're going
 or how we're going to get there.""
I finished my beer and clapped
 my hands for Mouley. ""How do
 you mean,
where we're going
?""


 ""Well, take half the countries
 in the world today. They're trying
 to industrialize, modernize,
 catch up with the advanced countries.
 Look at Egypt, and Israel,
 and India and China, and Yugoslavia
 and Brazil, and all the
 rest. Trying to drag themselves
 up to the level of the advanced
 countries, and all using different
 methods of doing it. But look
 at the so-called advanced countries.
 Up to their bottoms in
 problems. Juvenile delinquents,
 climbing crime and suicide rates,
 the loony-bins full of the balmy,
 unemployed, threat of war,
 spending all their money on armaments
 instead of things like
 schools. All the bloody mess of
 it. Why, a man from Mars would
 be fascinated, like.""


 Mouley came shuffling up in
 his babouche slippers and we
 both ordered another schooner
 of beer.


 Paul said seriously, ""You
 know, there's only one big snag
 in this sort of talk. I've sorted
 the whole thing out before, and
 you always come up against this
 brick wall. Where are they, these
 observers, or scholars, or spies
 or whatever they are? Sooner
 or later we'd nab one of them.
 You know, Scotland Yard, or
 the F.B.I., or Russia's secret
 police, or the French Sûreté, or
 Interpol. This world is so deep
 in police, counter-espionage outfits
 and security agents that an
 alien would slip up in time, no
 matter how much he'd been
 trained. Sooner or later, he'd slip
 up, and they'd nab him.""


 I shook my head. ""Not necessarily.
 The first time I ever considered
 this possibility, it seemed
 to me that such an alien would
 base himself in London or New
 York. Somewhere where he could
 use the libraries for research,
 get the daily newspapers and
 the magazines. Be right in the
 center of things. But now I don't
 think so. I think he'd be right
 here in Tangier.""


 ""Why Tangier?""


 ""It's the one town in the world
 where anything goes. Nobody
 gives a damn about you or your
 affairs. For instance, I've known
 you a year or more now, and I
 haven't the slightest idea of how
 you make your living.""


 ""That's right,"" Paul admitted.
 ""In this town you seldom even
 ask a man where's he's from. He
 can be British, a White Russian,
 a Basque or a Sikh and nobody
 could care less. Where are
you
from, Rupert?""


 ""California,"" I told him.


 ""No, you're not,"" he grinned.


 I was taken aback. ""What do
 you mean?""


 ""I felt your mind probe back
 a few minutes ago when I was
 talking about Scotland Yard or
 the F.B.I. possibly flushing an
 alien. Telepathy is a sense not
 trained by the humanoids. If
 they had it, your job—and mine—would
 be considerably more
 difficult. Let's face it, in spite of
 these human bodies we're disguised
 in, neither of us is
 humanoid. Where are you really
 from, Rupert?""


 ""Aldebaran,"" I said. ""How
 about you?""


 ""Deneb,"" he told me, shaking.


 We had a laugh and ordered
 another beer.


 ""What're you doing here on
 Earth?"" I asked him.


 ""Researching for one of our
 meat trusts. We're protein
 eaters. Humanoid flesh is considered
 quite a delicacy. How
 about you?""


 ""Scouting the place for thrill
 tourists. My job is to go around
 to these backward cultures and
 help stir up inter-tribal, or international,
 conflicts—all according
 to how advanced they
 are. Then our tourists come in—well
 shielded, of course—and get
 their kicks watching it.""


 Paul frowned. ""That sort of
 practice could spoil an awful
 lot of good meat.""

My senses came to me slowly and somehow shyly, as if not sure of their
 way or welcome. I felt first—pressure on my brow and chest, as if I
 lay face downward; then the tug and buffet of a strong, probing wind,
 insistent but not cold, upon my naked skin. Closing my hands, I felt
 them dig into coarse dirt. I turned my face downwind and opened my
 eyes. There was little to see, so thick was the dust cloud around me.
 Words formed themselves on my thick tongue, words that must have been
 spoken by so many reviving unfortunates through the ages:


 ""Where am I?""


 And at once there was an answer:


 ""
You lie upon the world Dondromogon.
""


 I knew the language of that answer, but where it came from—above,
 beneath, or indeed within me—I could not say. I lifted a hand, and
 knuckled dust from my eyes.


 ""How did I get here?"" I demanded of the speaker.


 ""It was ordered—by the Masters of the Worlds—that you should be
 brought from your own home planet, called Earth in the System of the
 star called Sun. Do you remember Earth?""


 And I did not know whether I remembered or not. Vague matters stirred
 deep in me, but I could not for certain say they were memories. I asked
 yet again:


 ""Who am I?""


 The voice had a note of triumph. ""You do not know that. It is as well,
 for this will be a birth and beginning of your destined leadership on
 Dondromogon.""


 ""Destined—leadership—"" I began to repeat, and fell silent. I had
 need to think. The voice was telling me that I had been snatched from
 worlds away, for a specified purpose here on whatever windswept planet
 Dondromogon might be. ""Birth and beginning—destined leadership—""
 Fantastic! And yet, for all I could say to the contrary, unvarnishedly
 true.


 ""Dondromogon?"" I mumbled. ""The name is strange to me.""


 ""It is a world the size of your native one,"" came words of information.
 ""Around a star it spins, light-years away from the world of your
 birth. One face of Dondromogon ever looks to the light and heat,
 wherefore its metals run in glowing seas. The other face is ever away
 in cold darkness, with its air freezing into solid chunks. But because
 Dondromogon wavers on its axis, there are two lunes of its surface
 which from time to time shift from night to day. These are habitable.""


 My eyes were tight shut against the dust, but they saw in imagination
 such a planet—one-half incandescent, one-half pitchy black. From pole
 to pole on opposite sides ran the two twilight zones, widest at the
 equators like the outer rind of two slices of melon. Of course, such
 areas, between the hot and cold hemispheres, would be buffeted by
 mighty gales ... the voice was to be heard again:


 ""War is fought between the two strips of habitable ground. War,
 unceasing, bitter, with no quarter asked, given or expected.
 Dondromogon was found and settled long ago, by adventurers from afar.
 Now come invaders, to reap the benefits of discovery and toil."" A
 pause. ""You find that thought unpleasant? You wish to right that
 wrong?""


 ""Anyone would wish that,"" I replied. ""But how—""


 ""You are going to ask how you were brought here. That is the mystery
 of the
Masters
."" The voice became grand. ""Suffice it that you were
 needed, and that the time was ripe. There is a proper time, like a
 proper place, for each thing and each happening. Now, go to your
 destiny.""


 I rose on my knees, shielding my face from the buffeting wind by
 lifting a forearm. Somewhere through the murky clouds showed a dim
 blocky silhouette, a building of sorts.


 The voice spoke no more. I had not the time to wonder about it. I got
 to my feet, bent double to keep from being blown over, and staggered
 toward the promised haven.


 I reached it, groped along until I found a door. There was no latch,
 handle or entry button, and I pounded heavily on the massive panels.
 The door opened from within, and I was blown inside, to fall sprawling.
I struck my forehead upon a floor of stone or concrete, and so was
 half-stunned, but still I could distinguish something like the sound
 of agitated voices. Then I felt myself grasped, by both shoulders,
 and drawn roughly erect. The touch restored my senses, and I wrenched
 myself violently free.


 What had seized me? That was my first wonder. On this strange world
 called Dondromogon, what manner of intelligent life bade defiance to
 heat and cold and storm, and built these stout structures, and now laid
 hands—were they hands indeed?—upon me? I swung around, setting my
 back to a solid wall.


 My first glance showed me that my companions were creatures like
 myself—two-legged, fair-skinned men, shorter and slighter than I, but
 clad in metal-faced garments and wearing weapons in their girdles. I
 saw that each bore a swordlike device with a curved guard, set in a
 narrow sheath as long as my arm. Each also had a shorter weapon, with
 a curved stock to fit the palm of the hand, borne snugly in a holster.
 With such arms I had a faint sense of familiarity.


 ""Who are you, and where are you from?"" said one of the two, a
 broad-faced middle-aged fellow. ""Don't lie any more than you can help.""


 I felt a stirring of the hair on my neck, but kept my voice mild and
 level: ""Why should I lie? Especially as I don't know who I am, or where
 I'm from, or anything that has happened longer ago than just a moment.
 I woke up out there in the dust storm, and I managed to come here for
 shelter.""


 ""He's a Newcomer spy,"" quoth the other. ""Let's put him under arrest.""


 ""And leave this gate unguarded?"" demanded the other. ""Sound the
 signal,"" and he jerked his head toward a system of levers and gauges on
 the wall beside the door-jamb.


 ""There's a bigger reward for capture than for warning,"" objected
 his friend in turn, ""and whoever comes to take this man will claim
 'capture.' I'll guard here, and you take him in, then we'll divide—""


 ""No. Yours is the idea. I'll guard and you take him in."" The second man
 studied me apprehensively. ""He's big, and looks strong, even without
 weapons.""


 ""Don't be afraid,"" I urged. ""I'll make no resistance, if you'll only
 conduct me to your commander. I can show him that I'm no spy or enemy.""


 Both stared narrowly. ""No spy? No enemy?"" asked the broad-faced one who
 had first spoken. Then, to his comrade: ""No reward, then.""


 ""I think there'll be a reward,"" was the rejoinder, and the second man's
 hand stole to the sword-weapon. With a whispering rasp it cleared from
 its scabbard. ""If he's dead, we get pay for both warning and capture—""


 His thumb touched a button at the pommel of the hilt. The dull blade
 suddenly glowed like heated iron, and from it crackled and pulsed
 little rainbow rays.


 There was no time to think or plan or ponder. I moved in, with a
 knowing speed that surprised me as much as the two guards. Catching the
 fellow's weapon wrist, I clamped it firmly and bent it back and around.
 He whimpered and swore, and his glowing sword dropped. Its radiant
 blade almost fell on my naked foot. Before the clang of its fall was
 through echoing, I had caught it up, and set the point within inches of
 its owner's unprotected face.


 ""Quiet, or I'll roast you,"" I told him.


 The other had drawn a weapon of his own, a pistol-form arrangement.
 I turned on him, but too late. He pressed the trigger, and from the
 muzzle came—not a projectile but a flying, spouting filament of cord
 that seemed to spring on me like a long thin snake and to fasten coil
 after coil around my body. The stuff that gushed from the gun-muzzle
 seemed plastic in form, but hardened so quickly upon contact with the
 air, it bound me like wire. Half a dozen adroit motions of the fellow's
 gun hand, and my arms were caught to my body. I dropped my sword to
 prevent it burning me, and tried to break away, but my bonds were too
 much for me.


 ""Let me out of this,"" I growled, and kicked at the man with my still
 unbound foot. He snapped a half-hitch on my ankle, and threw me
 heavily. Triumphant laughter came from both adversaries. Then:


 ""What's this?""
The challenge was clear, rich, authoritative. Someone else had come,
 from a rearward door into the stone-walled vestibule where the
 encounter was taking place.


 A woman this time, not of great height, and robust but not heavy. She
 was dressed for vigorous action in dark slacks with buskins to make
 them snug around ankles and calves, a jerkin of stout material that was
 faced with metal armor plates and left bare her round, strong arms. A
 gold-worked fillet bound her tawny hair back from a rosy, bold-featured
 face—a nose that was positively regal, a mouth short and firm but not
 hard, and blue eyes that just now burned and questioned. She wore a
 holstered pistol, and a cross-belt supported several instruments of a
 kind I could not remember seeing before. A crimson cloak gave color and
 dignity to her costume, and plainly she was someone of position, for
 both the men stiffened to attention.


 ""A spy,"" one ventured. ""He pushed in, claimed he was no enemy, then
 tried to attack—""


 ""They lie,"" I broke in, very conscious of my naked helplessness before
 her regard. ""They wanted to kill me and be rewarded for a false story
 of vigilance. I only defended myself.""


 ""Get him on his feet,"" the young woman said, and the two guards
 obeyed. Then her eyes studied me again. ""Gods! What a mountain of a
 man!"" she exclaimed. ""Can you walk, stranger?""


 ""Barely, with these bonds.""


 ""Then manage to do so."" She flung off her cloak and draped it over my
 nakedness. ""Walk along beside me. No tricks, and I promise you fair
 hearing.""


 We went through the door by which she had entered, into a corridor
 beyond. It was lighted by small, brilliant bulbs at regular intervals.
 Beyond, it gave into several passages. She chose one of them and
 conducted me along. ""You are surely not of us,"" she commented. ""Men I
 have seen who are heavier than you, but none taller. Whence came you?""


 I remembered the strange voice that had instructed me. ""I am from a
 far world,"" I replied. ""It is called—yes, Earth. Beyond that, I know
 nothing. Memory left me.""


 ""The story is a strange one,"" she commented. ""And your name?""


 ""I do not know that, either. Who are you?""


 ""Doriza—a gentlewoman of the guard. My inspection tour brought me by
 chance to where you fought my outposts. But it is not for you to ask
 questions. Enter here.""


 We passed through another door, and I found myself in an office. A man
 in richly-embossed armor platings sat there. He had a fringe of pale
 beard, and his eyes were bluer than the gentlewoman Doriza's.


 She made a gesture of salute, hand at shoulder height, and reported the
 matter. He nodded for her to fall back to a corner.


 ""Stranger,"" he said to me, ""can you think of no better tale to tell
 than you now offer?""


 ""I tell the truth,"" was my reply, not very gracious.


 ""You will have to prove that,"" he admonished me.


 ""What proof have I?"" I demanded. ""On this world of yours—Dondromogon,
 isn't it called?—I'm no more than an hour old. Accident or shock
 has taken my memory. Let me have a medical examination. A scientist
 probably can tell what happened to put me in such a condition.""


 ""I am a scientist,"" offered Doriza, and came forward. Her eyes met
 mine, suddenly flickered and lowered. ""His gaze,"" she muttered.


 The officer at the table was touching a button. An attendant appeared,
 received an order, and vanished again. In a few moments two other
 men came—one a heavily armed officer of rank, the other an elderly,
 bearded fellow in a voluminous robe that enfolded him in most dignified
 manner.


 This latter man opened wide his clear old eyes at sight of me.


 ""The stranger of the prophecy!"" he cried, in a voice that made us all
 jump.
The officer rose from behind the table. ""Are you totally mad, Sporr?
 You mystic doctors are too apt to become fuddled—""


 ""But it is, it is!"" The graybeard flourished a thin hand at me. ""Look
 at him, you of little faith! Your mind dwells so much on material
 strength that you lose touch with the spiritual—""


 He broke off, and wheeled on the attendant who had led him in. ""To my
 study,"" he commanded. ""On the shelf behind my desk, bring the great
 gold-bound book that is third from the right."" Then he turned back,
 and bowed toward me. ""Surely you are Yandro, the Conquering Stranger,""
 he said, intoning as if in formal prayer. ""Pardon these short-sighted
 ones—deign to save us from our enemies—""


 The girl Doriza spoke to the officer: ""If Sporr speaks truth, and he
 generally does, you have committed a blasphemy.""


 The other made a little grimace. ""This may be Yandro, though I'm a
 plain soldier and follow the classics very little. The First Comers are
 souls to worship, not to study. If indeed he is Yandro,"" and he was
 most respectful, ""he will appreciate, like a good military mind, my
 caution against possible impostors.""


 ""Who might Yandro be?"" I demanded, very uncomfortable in my bonds and
 loose draperies.


 Old Sporr almost crowed. ""You see? If he was a true imposter, he would
 come equipped with all plausible knowledge. As it is—""


 ""As it is, he may remember that the Conquering Stranger is foretold
 to come with no memory of anything,"" supplied the officer. ""Score one
 against you, Sporr. You should have been able to instruct me, not I
 you.""


 The attendant reentered, with a big book in his hands. It looked
 old and well-thumbed, with dim gold traceries on its binding. Sporr
 snatched it, and turned to a brightly colored picture. He looked once,
 his beard gaped, and he dropped to his knees.


 ""Happy, happy the day,"" he jabbered, ""that I was spared to see our
 great champion come among us in the flesh, as was foretold of ancient
 time by the First Comers!""


 Doriza and the officer crossed to his side, snatching the book. Their
 bright heads bent above it. Doriza was first to speak. ""It is very
 like,"" she half-stammered.


 The officer faced me, with a sort of baffled respect.


 ""I still say you will understand my caution,"" he addressed me, with
 real respect and shyness this time. ""If you are Yandro himself, you can
 prove it. The prophecy even sketches a thumb-print—"" And he held the
 book toward me.


 It contained a full-page likeness, in color, of myself wrapped in a
 scarlet robe. Under this was considerable printed description, and to
 one side a thumb-print, or a drawing of one, in black.


 ""Behold,"" Doriza was saying, ""matters which even expert identification
 men take into thought. The ears in the picture are like the ears of the
 real man—""


 ""That could be plastic surgery,"" rejoined the officer. ""Such things are
 artfully done by the Newcomers, and the red mantle he wears more easily
 assumed.""


 Doriza shook her head. ""That happens to be my cloak. I gave it to him
 because he was naked, and not for any treasonable masquerade. But the
 thumb-print—""


 ""Oh, yes, the thumb-print,"" I repeated wearily. ""By all means, study my
 thumbs, if you'll first take these bonds off of me.""


 ""Bonds,"" mumbled old Sporr. He got creakily up from his knees and
 bustled to me. From under his robe he produced a pouch, and took out a
 pencil-sized rod. Gingerly opening the red mantle, he touched my tether
 in several places with the glowing end of the rod. The coils dropped
 away from my grateful body and limbs. I thrust out my hands.


 ""Thumb-prints?"" I offered.


 Sporr had produced something else, a little vial of dark pigment. He
 carefully anointed one of my thumbs, and pressed it to the page. All
 three gazed.


 ""The same,"" said Doriza.


 And they were all on their knees before me.


 ""Forgive me, great Yandro,"" said the officer thickly. ""I did not know.""


 ""Get up,"" I bade them. ""I want to hear why I was first bound, and now
 worshipped.""
II


 They rose, but stood off respectfully. The officer spoke first. ""I am
 Rohbar, field commander of this defense position,"" he said with crisp
 respect. ""Sporr is a mystic doctor, full of godly wisdom. Doriza,
 a junior officer and chief of the guard. And you—how could you
 know?—are sent by the First Comers to save us from our enemies.""


 ""Enemies?"" I repeated.


 ""The Newcomers,"" supplemented Doriza. ""They have taken the ""Other Side""
 of Dondromogon, and would take our side as well. We defend ourselves
 at the poles. Now,"" and her voice rang joyously, ""you will lead us to
 defeat and crush them utterly!""


 ""Not naked like this,"" I said, and laughed. I must have sounded
 foolish, but it had its effect.


 ""Follow me, deign to follow me,"" Sporr said. ""Your clothing, your
 quarters, your destiny, all await you.""


 We went out by the door at the rear, and Sporr respectfully gestured me
 upon a metal-plated platform. Standing beside me, he tinkered with a
 lever. We dropped smoothly away into a dark corridor, past level after
 level of light and sound.


 ""Our cities are below ground,"" he quavered. ""Whipped by winds above,
 we must scrabble in the depths for life's necessities—chemicals to
 transmute into food, to weave into clothing, to weld into tools and
 weapons—""


 The mention of food brought to me the thought that I was hungry. I said
 as much, even as our elevator platform came to the lowest level and
 stopped.


 ""I have arranged for that,"" Sporr began, then fell silent, fingers
 combing his beard in embarrassment.


 ""Arranged food for me?"" I prompted sharply. ""As if you know I had come?
 What—""


 ""Pardon, great Yandro,"" babbled Sporr. ""I was saying that I arranged
 food, as always, for whatever guest should come. Please follow.""


 We entered a new small chamber, where a table was set with dishes of
 porcelain-like plastic. Sporr held a chair for me, and waited on me
 with the utmost gingerly respect. The food was a pungent and filling
 jelly, a little bundle of transparent leaves or scraps like cellophane
 and tasting of spice, and a tumbler of pink juice. I felt refreshed and
 satisfied, and thanked Sporr, who led me on to the next room.


 ""Behold!"" he said, with a dramatic gesture. ""Your garments, even as
 they have been preserved against your coming!""


 It was a sleeping chamber, with a cot made fast to the wall, a metal
 locker or cupboard, with a glass door through which showed the garments
 of which Sporr spoke.


 The door closed softly behind me—I was left alone.


 Knowing that it was expected of me, I went to the locker and opened
 the door. The garments inside were old, I could see, but well kept and
 serviceable. I studied their type, and my hands, if not my mind, seemed
 familiar with them.


 There was a kiltlike item, belted at the waist and falling to
 mid-thigh. A resilient band at the top, with a series of belt-holes,
 made it adaptable to my own body or to any other. Then came an upper
 garment, a long strip of soft, close-woven fabric that spiralled
 around the torso from hip to armpit, the end looping over the left
 shoulder and giving full play to the arms. A gold-worked fillet bound
 the brows and swept back my longish hair, knotting at the nape of the
 neck. The only fitted articles were a pair of shoes, metal-soled and
 soft-uppered, that went on well enough and ran cross-garters up to
 below the knee, like buskins. The case also held a platinum chain for
 the neck, a belt-bag, and a handsome sword, with clips to fasten them
 in place. These things, too, I donned, and closed the glass door.
The light struck it at such an angle as to make it serve for a
 full-length mirror. With some curiosity I gazed at my image.


 The close-fitting costume was rich and dark, with bright colors only
 for edgings and minor accessories. I myself—and it was as if I saw my
 body for the first time—towered rather bluffly, with great breadth
 of chest and shoulder, and legs robust enough to carry such bulk. The
 face was square but haggard, as if from some toil or pain which was now
 wiped from my recollection. That nose had been even bigger than it was
 now, but a fracture had shortened it somewhat. The eyes were deep set
 and dark and moody—small wonder!—the chin heavy, the mouth made grim
 by a scar at one corner. Black, shaggy hair hung down like brackets.
 All told, I looked like a proper person for physical labor, or even
 fierce fighting—but surely no inspirational leader or savior of a
 distressed people.


 I took the military cloak which Doriza had lent me and slung it over my
 shoulders. Turning, I clanked out on my metal-soled shoes.


 Sporr was waiting in the room where I had eaten. His eyes widened at
 sight of me, something like a grin of triumph flashed through his
 beard. Then he bowed, supple and humble, his palms together.


 ""It is indeed Yandro, our great chief,"" he mumbled. Then he turned and
 crossed the room. A sort of mouthpiece sprouted from the wall.


 ""I announce,"" he intoned into it. ""I announce, I, Sporr, the reader and
 fore-teller of wisdom. Yandro is with us, he awaits his partners and
 friends. Let them meet him in the audience hall.""


 Facing me again, he motioned most respectfully toward the door to the
 hall. I moved to open it, and he followed, muttering.


 Outside stood Doriza. Her blue eyes met mine, and her lips moved to
 frame a word. Then, suddenly, she was on her knee, catching my hand and
 kissing it.


 ""I serve Yandro,"" she vowed tremulously. ""Now and forever—and happy
 that I was fated to live when he returned for the rescue of all
 Dondromogon.""


 ""Please get up,"" I bade her, trying not to sound as embarrassed as I
 felt. ""Come with me. There is still much that I do not understand.""


 ""I am Yandro's orderly and helper,"" she said. Rising, she ranged
 herself at my left hand. ""Will Yandro come this way? He will be awaited
 in the audience hall.""


 It seemed to me then that the corridors were vast and mixed as a
 labyrinth, but Doriza guided me without the slightest hesitation past
 one tangled crossway after another. My questions she answered with a
 mixture of awe and brightness.


 ""It is necessary that we live like this,"" she explained. ""The hot air
 of Dondromogon's sunlit face is ever rising, and the cold air from
 the dark side comes rushing under to fill the vacuum. Naturally, our
 strip of twilight country is never free of winds too high and fierce to
 fight. No crops can grow outside, no domestic animals flourish. We must
 pen ourselves away from the sky and soil, with stout walls and heavy
 sunken parapets. Our deep mines afford every element for necessities of
 life.""
I looked at my garments, and hers. There were various kinds of fabric,
 which I now saw plainly to be synthetic. ""The other side, where those
 you call the Newcomers dwell and fight,"" I reminded. ""Is it also
 windswept? Why can two people not join forces and face toil and nature
 together? They should fight, not each other, but the elements.""


 Doriza had no answer that time, but Sporr spoke up behind us: ""Great
 Yandro is wise as well as powerful. But the Newcomers do not want to
 help, not even to conquer. They want to obliterate us. There is nothing
 to do—not for lifetimes—but to fight them back at the two poles.""


 We came to a main corridor. It had a line of armed guards, but no
 pedestrians or vehicles, though I thought I caught a murmur of far-off
 traffic. Doriza paused before a great portal, closed by a curtainlike
 sheet of dull metal. She spoke into a mouthpiece:


 ""Doriza, gentlewoman of the guard, conducts Yandro, the Conquering
 Stranger, to greet his lieutenants!""


 I have said that the portal was closed by a curtainlike metal sheet;
 and like a curtain it lifted, letting us through into the auditorium.


 That spacious chamber had rows of benches, with galleries above, that
 might have seated a thousand. However, only a dozen or so were present,
 on metal chairs ranged across the stage upon which we entered. They
 were all men but two, and wore robes of black, plum-purple or red. At
 sight of me, they rose together, most respectfully. They looked at me,
 and I looked at them.


 My first thought was, that if these were people of authority and trust
 in the nation I seemed destined to save, my work was cut out for me.


 Not that they really seemed stupid—none had the look, or the
 subsequent action, of stupidity. But they were not pleasant. Their
 dozen pairs of eyes fixed me with some steadiness, but with no
 frankness anywhere. One man had a round, greedy-seeming face. Another
 was too narrow and cunning to look it. Of the women, one was nearly
 as tall as I and nobly proportioned, with hair of a red that would be
 inspiring were it not so blatantly dyed. The other was a little wisp of
 a brunette, with teeth too big for her scarlet mouth and bright eyes
 like some sort of a rodent. They all wore jewelry. Too much jewelry.


 My mind flew back to the two scrubby, venial guardsmen who had first
 welcomed me; to stuffy Rohbar, the commander; to Sporr, spry and clever
 enough, but somehow unwholesome; Doriza—no, she was not like these
 others, who may have lived too long in their earth-buried shelters. And
 Doriza now spoke to the gathering:


 ""Yandro, folk of the Council! He deigns to give you audience.""


 ""
Yandro!
""


 They all spoke the name in chorus, and bowed toward me.


 Silence then, a silence which evidently I must break. I broke it:
 ""Friends, I am among you with no more memory or knowledge than an
 infant. I hear wonderful things, of which I seem to be the center. Are
 they true?""


 ""The tenth part of the wonders which concern mighty Yandro have not
 been told,"" intoned Sporr, ducking his bearded head in a bow, but
 fixing me with his wise old eyes.


 One of the group, called Council by Doriza, now moved a pace forward.
 He was the greedy-faced man, short but plump, and very conscious of
 the dignified folds of his purple robe. One carefully-tended hand
 brushed back his ginger-brown hair, then toyed with a little moustache.


 ""I am Gederr, senior of this Council,"" he purred. ""If Yandro permits, I
 will speak simply. Our hopes have been raised by Yandro's return—the
 return presaged of old by those who could see the future, and more
 recently by the death in battle of the Newcomer champion, called Barak.""


 ""Barak!"" I repeated. ""I—I—"" And I paused. When I had to learn my own
 name, how could it be that I sensed memory of another's name?


 ""Barak was a brute—mighty, but a brute."" Thus Gederr continued.
 ""Weapons in his hands were the instruments of fate. His hands alone
 caused fear and ruin. But it pleased our fortune-bringing stars to
 encompass his destruction."" He grinned, and licked his full lips. ""Now,
 even as they are without their battle-leader, so we have ours.""


 ""You honor me,"" I told him. ""Yet I still know little. It seems that I
 am expected to aid and lead and save the people of this world called
 Dondromogon. But I must know them before I can help.""


 Gederr turned his eyes upon the woman with the red hair, and gestured
 to her ""Tell him, Elonie."" Then he faced me. ""Have we Yandro's
 permission to sit?""


 ""By all means,"" I granted, a little impatiently, and sat down myself.
 The others followed suit—the Council on their range of chairs, Doriza
 on a bench near me, Sporr somewhere behind. The woman called Elonie
 remained upon her sandalled feet, great eyes the color of deep green
 water fixed upon me.

HER ONLY PASSION WAS BEAUTY—BEAUTY WHICH WOULD LAST FOREVER.
 AND FOR IT—SHE'D DO ANYTHING!

 Ninon stretched. And purred, almost. There was something lazily catlike
 in her flexing; languid, yet ferally alert. The silken softness of her
 couch yielded to her body as she rubbed against it in sensual delight.
 There was almost the litheness of youth in her movements.


 It was true that some of her joints seemed to have a hint of stiffness
 in them, but only
she
knew it. And if some of the muscles beneath her
 polished skin did not respond with quite the resilience of the youth
 they once had, only
she
knew that, too.
But they would again
, she
 told herself fiercely.


 She caught herself. She had let down her guard for an instant, and a
 frown had started. She banished it imperiously. Frowns—just one
 frown—could start a wrinkle! And nothing was as stubborn as a wrinkle.
 One soft, round, white, long-nailed finger touched here, and here, and
 there—the corners of her eyes, the corners of her mouth, smoothing
 them.


 Wrinkles acknowledged only one master, the bio-knife of the facial
 surgeons. But the bio-knife could not thrust deep enough to excise the
 stiffness in a joint; was not clever enough to remold the outlines of a
 figure where they were beginning to blur and—sag.


 No one else could see it—yet. But Ninon could!


 Again the frown almost came, and again she scourged it fiercely into the
 back of her mind. Time was her enemy. But she had had other enemies, and
 destroyed them, one way or another, cleverly or ruthlessly as
 circumstances demanded. Time, too, could be destroyed. Or enslaved.
 Ninon sorted through her meagre store of remembered reading. Some old
 philosopher had said, ""If you can't whip 'em, join 'em!"" Crude, but apt.


 Ninon wanted to smile. But smiles made wrinkles, too. She was content to
 feel that sureness of power in her grasp—the certain knowledge that
 she, first of all people, would turn Time on itself and destroy it. She
 would be youthful again. She would thread through the ages to come, like
 a silver needle drawing a golden filament through the layer on layer of
 the cloth of years that would engarment her eternal youth. Ninon knew
 how.


 Her shining, gray-green eyes strayed to the one door in her apartment
 through which no man had ever gone. There the exercising machines; the
 lotions; the unguents; the diets; the radioactive drugs; the records of
 endocrine transplantations, of blood transfusions. She dismissed them
 contemptuously. Toys! The mirages of a pseudo-youth. She would leave
 them here for someone else to use in masking the downhill years.


 There, on the floor beside her, was the answer she had sought so long. A
 book. ""Time in Relation to Time."" The name of the author, his academic
 record in theoretical physics, the cautious, scientific wording of his
 postulates, meant nothing to her. The one thing that had meaning for her
 was that Time could be manipulated. And she would manipulate it. For
 Ninon!


 The door chimes tinkled intimately. Ninon glanced at her watch—Robert
 was on time. She arose from the couch, made sure that the light was
 behind her at just the right angle so he could see the outlines of her
 figure through the sheerness of her gown, then went to the door and
 opened it.


 A young man stood there. Young, handsome, strong, his eyes aglow with
 the desire he felt, Ninon knew, when he saw her. He took one quick step
 forward to clasp her in his strong young arms.


 ""Ninon, my darling,"" he whispered huskily.


 Ninon did not have to make her voice throaty any more, and that annoyed
 her too. Once she had had to do it deliberately. But now, through the
 years, it had deepened.


 ""Not yet, Robert,"" she whispered. She let him feel the slight but firm
 resistance so nicely calculated to breach his own; watched the deepening
 flush of his cheeks with the clinical sureness that a thousand such
 experiences with men had given her.


 Then, ""Come in, Robert,"" she said, moving back a step. ""I've been
 waiting for you.""


 She noted, approvingly, that Robert was in his spaceman's uniform, ready
 for the morrow's flight, as he went past her to the couch. She pushed
 the button which closed and locked the door, then seated herself beside
 the young spaceman on the silken couch.


 His hands rested on her shoulders and he turned her until they faced
 each other.


 ""Ninon,"" he said, ""you are so beautiful. Let me look at you for a long
 time—to carry your image with me through all of time and space.""


 Again Ninon let him feel just a hint of resistance, and risked a tiny
 pout. ""If you could just take me with you, Robert....""


 Robert's face clouded. ""If I only could!"" he said wistfully. ""If there
 were only room. But this is an experimental flight—no more than two can
 go.""


 Again his arms went around her and he leaned closer.


 ""Wait!"" Ninon said, pushing him back.


 ""Wait? Wait for what?"" Robert glanced at his watch. ""Time is running
 out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn—three hours from now.""


 Ninon said, ""But that's three hours, Robert.""


 ""But I haven't slept yet tonight. There's been so much to do. I should
 rest a little.""


 ""I'll be more than rest for you.""


 ""Yes, Ninon.... Oh, yes.""


 ""Not yet, darling."" Again her hands were between them. ""First, tell me
 about the flight tomorrow.""


 The young spaceman's eyes were puzzled, hurt. ""But Ninon, I've told you
 before ... there is so much of you that I want to remember ... so little
 time left ... and you'll be gone when I get back....""


 Ninon let her gray-green eyes narrow ever so slightly as she leaned away
 from him. But he blundered on.


 ""... or very old, no longer the Ninon I know ... oh, all right. But you
 know all this already. We've had space flight for years, but only
 rocket-powered, restricting us to our own system. Now we have a new kind
 of drive. Theoretically we can travel faster than light—how many times
 faster we don't know yet. I'll start finding out tomorrow, with the
 first test flight of the ship in which the new drive is installed. If it
 works, the universe is ours—we can go anywhere.""


 ""Will it work?"" Ninon could not keep the avid greediness out of her
 voice.


 Robert said, hesitantly, ""We think it will. I'll know better by this
 time tomorrow.""


 ""What of you—of me—. What does this mean to us—to people?""


 Again the young spaceman hesitated. ""We ... we don't know, yet. We think
 that time won't have the same meaning to everyone....""


 ""... When you travel faster than light. Is that it?""


 ""Well ... yes. Something like that.""


 ""And I'll be—old—or dead, when you get back? If you get back?""


 Robert leaned forward and buried his face in the silvery-blonde hair
 which swept down over Ninon's shoulders.


 ""Don't say it, darling,"" he murmured.


 This time Ninon permitted herself a wrinkling smile. If she was right,
 and she knew she was, it could make no difference now. There would be no
 wrinkles—there would be only the soft flexible skin, naturally soft and
 flexible, of real youth.


 She reached behind her, over the end of the couch, and pushed three
 buttons. The light, already soft, dimmed slowly to the faintest of
 glows; a suave, perfumed dusk as precisely calculated as was the exact
 rate at which she let all resistance ebb from her body.


 Robert's voice was muffled through her hair. ""What were those clicks?""
 he asked.


 Ninon's arms stole around his neck. ""The lights,"" she whispered, ""and a
 little automatic warning to tell you when it's time to go....""


 The boy did not seem to remember about the third click. Ninon was not
 quite ready to tell him, yet. But she would....
Two hours later a golden-voiced bell chimed, softly, musically. The
 lights slowly brightened to no more than the lambent glow which was all
 that Ninon permitted. She ran her fingers through the young spaceman's
 tousled hair and shook him gently.


 ""It's time to go, Robert,"" she said.


 Robert fought back from the stubborn grasp of sleep. ""So soon?"" he
 mumbled.


 ""And I'm going with you,"" Ninon said.


 This brought him fully awake. ""I'm sorry, Ninon. You can't!"" He sat up
 and yawned, stretched, the healthy stretch of resilient youth. Then he
 reached for the jacket he had tossed over on a chair.


 Ninon watched him with envious eyes, waiting until he was fully alert.


 ""Robert!"" she said, and the youth paused at the sharpness of her voice.
 ""How old are you?""


 ""I've told you before, darling—twenty-four.""


 ""How old do you think I am?""


 He gazed at her in silent curiosity for a moment, then said, ""Come to
 think of it, you've never told me. About twenty-two or -three, I'd say.""


 ""Tomorrow is my birthday. I'll be fifty-two.""


 He stared at her in shocked amazement. Then, as his gaze went over the
 smooth lines of her body, the amazement gave way to disbelief, and he
 chuckled. ""The way you said it, Ninon, almost had me believing you. You
 can't possibly be that old, or anywhere near it. You're joking.""


 Ninon's voice was cold. She repeated it: ""I am fifty-two years old. I
 knew your father, before you were born.""


 This time she could see that he believed it. The horror he felt was easy
 to read on his face while he struggled to speak. ""Then ... God help
 me ... I've been making love to ... an old woman!"" His voice was low,
 bitter, accusing.


 Ninon slapped him.


 He swayed slightly, then his features froze as the red marks of her
 fingers traced across his left cheek. At last he bowed, mockingly, and
 said, ""Your pardon, Madame. I forgot myself. My father taught me to be
 respectful to my elders.""


 For that Ninon could have killed him. As he turned to leave, her hand
 sought the tiny, feather-light beta-gun cunningly concealed in the folds
 of her gown. But the driving force of her desire made her stay her hand.


 ""Robert!"" she said in peremptory tones.


 The youth paused at the door and glanced back, making no effort to
 conceal the loathing she had aroused in him. ""What do you want?""


 Ninon said, ""You'll never make that flight without me.... Watch!""


 Swiftly she pushed buttons again. The room darkened, as before. Curtains
 at one end divided and rustled back, and a glowing screen sprang to life
 on the wall revealed behind them. And there, in life and movement and
 color and sound and dimension, she—and Robert—projected themselves,
 together on the couch, beginning at the moment Ninon had pressed the
 three buttons earlier. Robert's arms were around her, his face buried in
 the hair falling over her shoulders....


 The spaceman's voice was doubly bitter in the darkened room. ""So that's
 it,"" he said. ""A recording! Another one for your collection, I suppose.
 But of what use is it to you? I have neither money nor power. I'll be
 gone from this Earth in an hour. And you'll be gone from it,
 permanently—at your age—before I get back. I have nothing to lose, and
 you have nothing to gain.""


 Venomous with triumph, Ninon's voice was harsh even to her ears. ""On the
 contrary, my proud and impetuous young spaceman, I have much to gain,
 more than you could ever understand. When it was announced that you were
 to be trained to command this experimental flight I made it my business
 to find out everything possible about you. One other man is going. He
 too has had the same training, and could take over in your place. A
 third man has also been trained, to stand by in reserve. You are
 supposed to have rested and slept the entire night. If the Commandant of
 Space Research knew that you had not....""


 ""I see. That's why you recorded my visit tonight. But I leave in less
 than an hour. You'd never be able to tell Commander Pritchard in time to
 make any difference, and he'd never come here to see....""


 Ninon laughed mirthlessly, and pressed buttons again. The screen
 changed, went blank for a moment, then figures appeared again. On the
 couch were she and a man, middle-aged, dignified in appearance,
 uniformed. Blane Pritchard, Commandant of Space Research. His arms were
 around her, and his face was buried in her hair. She let the recording
 run for a moment, then shut it off and turned up the lights.


 To Robert, she said, ""I think Commander Pritchard would be here in five
 minutes if I called and told him that I have information which seriously
 affects the success of the flight.""


 The young spaceman's face was white and stricken as he stared for long
 moments, wordless, at Ninon. Then in defeated tones he said, ""You
 scheming witch! What do you want?""


 There was no time to gloat over her victory. That would come later.
 Right now minutes counted. She snatched up a cloak, pushed Robert out
 through the door and hurried him along the hall and out into the street
 where his car waited.


 ""We must hurry,"" she said breathlessly. ""We can get to the spaceship
 ahead of schedule, before your flight partner arrives, and be gone from
 Earth before anyone knows what is happening. I'll be with you, in his
 place.""


 Robert did not offer to help her into the car, but got in first and
 waited until she closed the door behind her, then sped away from the
 curb and through the streets to the spaceport.


 Ninon said, ""Tell me, Robert, isn't it true that if a clock recedes from
 Earth at the speed of light, and if we could watch it as it did so, it
 would still be running but it would never show later time?""


 The young man said gruffly, ""Roughly so, according to theory.""


 ""And if the clock went away from Earth faster than the speed of light,
 wouldn't it run backwards?""


 The answer was curtly cautious. ""It might appear to.""


 ""Then if people travel at the speed of light they won't get any older?""


 Robert flicked a curious glance at her. ""If you could watch them from
 Earth they appear not to. But it's a matter of relativity....""


 Ninon rushed on. She had studied that book carefully. ""And if people
 travel faster than light, a lot faster, they'll grow younger, won't
 they?""


 Robert said, ""So that's what's in your mind."" He busied himself with
 parking the car at the spaceport, then went on: ""You want to go back in
 the past thirty years, and be a girl again. While I grow younger, too,
 into a boy, then a child, a baby, at last nothing....""


 ""I'll try to be sorry for you, Robert.""


 Ninon felt again for her beta-gun as he stared at her for a long minute,
 his gaze a curious mixture of amusement and pity. Then, ""Come on,"" he
 said flatly, turning to lead the way to the gleaming space ship which
 poised, towering like a spire, in the center of the blast-off basin. And
 added, ""I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.""


 The young man's words seemed to imply a secret knowledge that Ninon did
 not possess. A sudden chill of apprehension rippled through her, and
 almost she turned back. But no ... there was the ship! There was youth;
 and beauty; and the admiration of men, real admiration. Suppleness in
 her muscles and joints again. No more diets. No more transfusions. No
 more transplantations. No more the bio-knife. She could smile again, or
 frown again. And after a few years she could make the trip again ... and
 again....
The space ship stood on fiery tiptoes and leaped from Earth, high into
 the heavens, and out and away. Past rusted Mars. Past the busy
 asteroids. Past the sleeping giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Past pale
 Uranus and Neptune; and frigid, shivering Pluto. Past a senseless,
 flaming comet rushing inward towards its rendezvous with the Sun. And on
 out of the System into the steely blackness of space where the stars
 were hard, burnished points of light, unwinking, motionless; eyes—eyes
 staring at the ship, staring through the ports at Ninon where she lay,
 stiff and bruised and sore, in the contoured acceleration sling.


 The yammering rockets cut off, and the ship seemed to poise on the ebon
 lip of a vast Stygian abyss.


 Joints creaking, muscles protesting, Ninon pushed herself up and out of
 the sling against the artificial gravity of the ship. Robert was already
 seated at the controls.


 ""How fast are we going?"" she asked; and her voice was rusty and harsh.


 ""Barely crawling, astronomically,"" he said shortly. ""About forty-six
 thousand miles a minute.""


 ""Is that as fast as the speed of light?""


 ""Hardly, Madame,"" he said, with a condescending chuckle.


 ""Then make it go faster!"" she screamed. ""And faster and faster—hurry!
 What are we waiting for?""


 The young spaceman swivelled about in his seat. He looked haggard and
 drawn from the strain of the long acceleration. Despite herself, Ninon
 could feel the sagging in her own face; the sunkenness of her eyes. She
 felt tired, hating herself for it—hating having this young man see
 her.


 He said, ""The ship is on automatic control throughout. The course is
 plotted in advance; all operations are plotted. There is nothing we can
 do but wait. The light drive will cut in at the planned time.""


 ""Time! Wait! That's all I hear!"" Ninon shrieked. ""Do something!""


 Then she heard it. A low moan, starting from below the limit of
 audibility, then climbing, up and up and up and up, until it was a
 nerve-plucking whine that tore into her brain like a white-hot tuning
 fork. And still it climbed, up beyond the range of hearing, and up and
 up still more, till it could no longer be felt. But Ninon, as she
 stumbled back into the acceleration sling, sick and shaken, knew it was
 still there. The light drive!


 She watched through the ports. The motionless, silent stars were moving
 now, coming toward them, faster and faster, as the ship swept out of the
 galaxy, shooting into her face like blazing pebbles from a giant
 slingshot.


 She asked, ""How fast are we going now?""


 Robert's voice sounded far off as he replied, ""We are approaching the
 speed of light.""


 ""Make it go faster!"" she cried. ""Faster! Faster!""


 She looked out the ports again; looked back behind them—and saw shining
 specks of glittering blackness falling away to melt into the sootiness
 of space. She shuddered, and knew without asking that these were stars
 dropping behind at a rate greater than light speed.


 ""Now how fast are we going?"" she asked. She was sure that her voice was
 stronger; that strength was flowing back into her muscles and bones.


 ""Nearly twice light speed.""


 ""Faster!"" she cried. ""We must go much faster! I must be young again.
 Youthful, and gay, and alive and happy.... Tell me, Robert, do you feel
 younger yet?""


 He did not answer.
Ninon lay in the acceleration sling, gaining strength, and—she
 knew—youth. Her lost youth, coming back, to be spent all over again.
 How wonderful! No woman in all of time and history had ever done it. She
 would be immortal; forever young and lovely. She hardly noticed the
 stiffness in her joints when she got to her feet again—it was just from
 lying in the sling so long.


 She made her voice light and gay. ""Are we not going very, very fast,
 now, Robert?""


 He answered without turning. ""Yes. Many times the speed of light.""


 ""I knew it ... I knew it! Already I feel much younger. Don't you feel it
 too?""


 He did not answer, and Ninon kept on talking. ""How long have we been
 going, Robert?""


 He said, ""I don't know ... depends on where you are.""


 ""It must be hours ... days ... weeks. I should be hungry. Yes, I think I
 am hungry. I'll need food, lots of food. Young people have good
 appetites, don't they, Robert?""


 He pointed to the provisions locker, and she got food out and made it
 ready. But she could eat but a few mouthfuls.
It's the excitement
, she
 told herself. After all, no other woman, ever, had gone back through the
 years to be young again....
Long hours she rested in the sling, gaining more strength for the day
 when they would land back on Earth and she could step out in all the
 springy vitality of a girl of twenty. And then as she watched through
 the ingenious ports she saw the stars of the far galaxies beginning to
 wheel about through space, and she knew that the ship had reached the
 halfway point and was turning to speed back through space to Earth,
 uncounted light-years behind them—or before them. And she would still
 continue to grow younger and younger....


 She gazed at the slightly-blurred figure of the young spaceman on the
 far side of the compartment, focussing her eyes with effort. ""You are
 looking much younger, Robert,"" she said. ""Yes, I think you are becoming
 quite boyish, almost childish, in appearance.""


 He nodded slightly. ""You may be right,"" he said.


 ""I must have a mirror,"" she cried. ""I must see for myself how much
 younger I have become. I'll hardly recognize myself....""


 ""There is no mirror,"" he told her.


 ""No mirror? But how can I see....""


 ""Non-essentials were not included in the supplies on this ship. Mirrors
 are not essential—to men.""


 The mocking gravity in his voice infuriated her. ""Then you shall be my
 mirror,"" she said. ""Tell me, Robert, am I not now much younger? Am I not
 becoming more and more beautiful? Am I not in truth the most desirable
 of women?... But I forget. After all, you are only a boy, by now.""


 He said, ""I'm afraid our scientists will have some new and interesting
 data on the effects of time in relation to time. Before long we'll begin
 to decelerate. It won't be easy or pleasant. I'll try to make you as
 comfortable as possible.""


 Ninon felt her face go white and stiff with rage. ""What do you mean?""


 Robert said, coldly brutal, ""You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year
 of your fifty-two!""


 Ninon snatched out the little beta-gun, then, leveled it and fired. And
 watched without remorse as the hungry electrons streamed forth to strike
 the young spaceman, turning him into a motionless, glowing figure which
 rapidly became misty and wraith-like, at last to disappear, leaving only
 a swirl of sparkling haze where he had stood. This too disappeared as
 its separate particles drifted to the metallite walls of the space ship,
 discharged their energy and ceased to sparkle, leaving only a thin film
 of dust over all.
After a while Ninon got up again from the sling and made her way to the
 wall. She polished the dust away from a small area of it, trying to make
 the spot gleam enough so that she could use it for a mirror. She
 polished a long time, until at last she could see a ghostly reflection
 of her face in the rubbed spot.


 Yes, unquestionably she was younger, more beautiful. Unquestionably Time
 was being kind to her, giving her back her youth. She was not sorry that
 Robert was gone—there would be many young men, men her own age, when
 she got back to Earth. And that would be soon. She must rest more, and
 be ready.


 The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated as it
 found its way back into the galaxy from which it had started. Found its
 way back into the System which had borne it. Ninon watched through the
 port as it slid in past the outer planets. Had they changed? No, she
 could not see that they had—only she had changed—until Saturn loomed
 up through the port, so close by, it looked, that she might touch it.
 But Saturn had no rings. Here was change. She puzzled over it a moment,
 frowning then forgot it when she recognized Jupiter again as Saturn fell
 behind. Next would be Mars....


 But what was this? Not Mars! Not any planet she knew, or had seen
 before. Yet there, ahead, was Mars! A new planet, where the asteroids
 had been when she left! Was this the same system? Had there been a
 mistake in the calculations of the scientists and engineers who had
 plotted the course of the ship? Was something wrong?


 But no matter—she was still Ninon. She was young and beautiful. And
 wherever she landed there would be excitement and rushing about as she
 told her story. And men would flock to her. Young, handsome men!


 She tottered back to the sling, sank gratefully into the comfort of it,
 closed her eyes, and waited.
The ship landed automatically, lowering itself to the land on a pillar
 of rushing flame, needing no help from its passenger. Then the flame
 died away—and the ship—and Ninon—rested, quietly, serenely, while the
 rocket tubes crackled and cooled. The people outside gathered at a safe
 distance from it, waiting until they could come closer and greet the
 brave passengers who had voyaged through space from no one knew where.
There was shouting and laughing and talking, and much speculation.
""The ship is from Maris, the red planet,"" someone said.
And another: ""No, no! It is not of this system. See how the hull is
 pitted—it has traveled from afar.""
An old man cried: ""It is a demon ship. It has come to destroy us all.""
A murmur went through the crowd, and some moved farther back for
 safety, watching with alert curiosity.
Then an engineer ventured close, and said, ""The workmanship is similar
 to that in the space ship we are building, yet not the same. It is
 obviously not of our Aerth.""
And a savant said, ""Yes, not of this Aerth. But perhaps it is from a
 parallel time stream, where there is a system with planets and peoples
 like us.""
Then a hatch opened in the towering flank of the ship, and a ramp slid
 forth and slanted to the ground. The mingled voices of the crowd
 attended it. The fearful ones backed farther away. Some stood their
 ground. And the braver ones moved closer.
But no one appeared in the open hatch; no one came down the ramp. At
 last the crowd surged forward again.
Among them were a youth and a girl who stood, hand in hand, at the foot
 of the ramp, gazing at it and the ship with shining eyes, then at each
 other.
She said, ""I wonder, Robin, what it would be like to travel through far
 space on such a ship as that.""
He squeezed her hand and said, ""We'll find out, Nina. Space travel will
 come, in our time, they've always said—and there is the proof of it.""
The girl rested her head against the young man's shoulder. ""You'll be
 one of the first, won't you, Robin? And you'll take me with you?""
He slipped an arm around her. ""Of course. You know, Nina, our
 scientists say that if one could travel faster than the speed of light
 one could live in reverse. So when we get old we'll go out in space,
 very, very fast, and we'll grow young again, together!""
Then a shout went up from the two men who had gone up the ramp into the
 ship to greet whoever was aboard. They came hurrying down, and Robin and
 Nina crowded forward to hear what they had to report.
They were puffing from the rush of their excitement. ""There is no one
 alive on the ship,"" they cried. ""Only an old, withered, white-haired
 lady, lying dead ... and alone. She must have fared long and far to have
 lived so long, to be so old in death. Space travel must be pleasant,
 indeed. It made her very happy, very, very happy—for there is a smile
 on her face.""

Here's what happens when two Master
 
Spies tangle ... and stay that way!
""Nothing, nothing to get upset about,"" Pashkov said soothingly, taking
 his friend's arm as they came out of the villa forty miles from Moscow.
 Pashkov looked like a roly-poly zoo attendant leading a tame bear.
 ""Erase his memory, give him a new name and feed him more patriotism.
 Very simple.""


 Medvedev raised his hand threateningly. ""Don't come howling to me if
 everybody guesses he is nothing but a robot.""


 Pashkov glanced back at the house. Since the publication of
Dentist
 Amigovitch
, this house had become known all over the world as Boris
 Knackenpast's villa. Now the house was guarded by a company of
 soldiers to keep visitors out. From an open window Pashkov heard the
 clicking of a typewriter.


 ""It's when they're not like robots that everybody suspects them,"" he
 said, climbing into his flier. ""Petchareff will send you word when to
 announce his 'death'.""


 ""A question, brother.""


 ""No questions.""


 ""Who smuggled the manuscript out of Russia?""


 Pashkov frowned convincingly. ""Comrade Petchareff has suspected even
 me.""


 He took off for Moscow, poking his flier up through the clouds and
 flying close to them, as was his habit. Then he switched on the radio
 and got Petchareff's secretary. ""Nadezhda?""


 ""I know what you're up to, Seven One Three,"" Nadezhda Brunhildova said.
 ""Don't try to fool
me
, you confidence man. You are coming in?""


 ""In ten minutes. What have I done now?""


 ""You were supposed to make funeral arrangements for Knackenpast, so
 what are you doing in Stockholm?""


 ""Stockholm?""


 ""You're lying and I'll kill you. Don't you think I know about Anastina,
 that she-nurse in the Stockholm National Hospital?""


 ""Darling, why so cruel? Anastina is one of our contacts. Besides, she's
 cross-eyed and buck-toothed.""


 ""Beast!"" She switched him to Petchareff.


 ""What's been keeping you, Pashkov?""


 ""Consoling Medvedev. Am I supposed to be in Stockholm?""


 ""Never mind, get here at once. What size hospital gown do you wear?""


 ""Hospital gown?""


 ""Stockholm embassy says you're in the National Hospital there. In a
 hospital gown. I got through to Anastina. She says it's Colonel James
 again. He looks like you now.""


 Pashkov grunted.


 ""I'll never understand,"" said Petchareff, ""why all top secret agents
 have to look like bankers. Anastina says Colonel James was operated on
 by a Monsieur Fanti. What do you know about him?""


 ""He's a theatrical surgeon.""


 ""You're not playing one of your jokes, Pashkov?""


 ""Hardly.""


 ""You'd better be in my office in ten minutes. What size hospital gown?""


 ""Short and fat,"" Pashkov said, and switched off.


 Most countries wanted to break his neck, and his own Motherland did not
 always trust him. But he enjoyed his work—enjoyed it as much as his
 closest professional rival, Colonel James, U.S.A.
Pashkov landed on the roof of Intelligence in the northeast corner of
 the Kremlin, hitched up his pants and rode down.


 In his office, Petchareff removed the cigar from his mouth as Pashkov
 came in. ""Medvedev get my orders?""


 ""He's preparing a new super-patriotic writer to replace Boris
 Knackenpast,"" Pashkov reported. ""When you give the word, he will call
Izvestia
and tell them Boris is dead.""


 Petchareff glanced at his calendar. ""We have two other state funerals
 this week. You made it plain, I hope, we want no repetition of
 Knackenpast's peace nonsense?""


 ""No more Gandhi or Schweitzer influences. The new literature,"" Pashkov
 promised, raising a chubby finger, ""will be a pearl necklace of
 government slogans.""


 Nadezhda buzzed the intercom. ""The man from the Bolshoi Theater is
 here, Comrade.""


 ""Send him in.""


 A small man hurried into the room. He had a narrow face and the
 mustache of a mouse and a mousy nose, but his eyes were big rabbit
 eyes. He bowed twice quickly, placed a package on the desk with
 trembling forepaws and bowed twice again.


 Petchareff tore open the package. ""You got the real thing? No bad
 imitation?""


 ""Exactly, exactly,"" the mouse piped. ""No difference, Comrade."" He held
 his paws as in prayer and his pointed mouth quivered.


 Petchareff held up the hospital gown. On the back of the gown was
 printed in indelible ink:
stockholm national hospital

 courtesy of

 Coca-Cola


 Petchareff tossed the gown to Pashkov. ""This is what Colonel James is
 wearing,"" he said, dismissing the mouse, who bowed twice and scurried
 out.


 ""Try and split the allies,"" Pashkov muttered, reading the legend on the
 gown.


 Petchareff blew cigar smoke in his face. ""If Colonel James makes a
 monkey of you once more, you're through, Pashkov. You don't take your
 job seriously enough. You bungle this and I'll have you transferred to
 our Cultural Information Center in Chicago.""


 Pashkov winced.


 ""Now, you'll go to Stockholm and switch places with the American
 colonel and find out what they're up to. Zubov's kidnaping team is
 there already, at Hotel Reisen. Any questions?""


 ""I thought Zubov was a zoological warfare expert. What is he doing with
 a kidnaping team?""


 ""His team is more agile. On your way.""


 In the front office, Pashkov stopped to kiss Nadezhda Brunhildova
 goodby. ""I may not return from this dangerous mission. Give me a tender
 kiss.""


 Nadezhda was a big girl with hefty arms, captain of her local broom
 brigade. ""Monster!"" She seized him by the collar. ""Is Anastina
 dangerous?""


 ""Darling!""


 ""Bitter sweetness!"" she howled, dropping him. ""Go, love. Make me
 miserable.""
Pashkov spent an hour at Central Intelligence. Nothing unusual going on
 in Stockholm: an industrial exhibit, the Swedish Academy in session,
 a sociology seminar on prison reform, a forty-man trade mission from
 India.


 An addendum to the Stockholm file listed two Cuban agents operating
 from Fralsningsarmen's Economy Lodgings. They were buying small arms
 and ammunition. He thought a moment, impressed the Cubans' address on
 his memory, and went to his flier.


 He did not fly to Hotel Reisen at once. Zubov's kidnaping team could
 wait. Coming slowly over Stockholm he spotted the National Hospital and
 circled.


 A line of ambulance fliers was parked on the ground in the ambulance
 court. On the hospital roof, he noticed, apart from private fliers,
 stood a flier that resembled his own.


 He veered away, detoured around Riddarholmen, and five minutes later
 landed on the roof of Fralsningsarmen's Economy Lodgings—the Salvation
 Army flophouse.


 ""My Cuban friends,"" Pashkov inquired in fluent English at the desk on
 the top floor. ""Are they in?""


 The old desk clerk looked like a stork. ""Yu, room six fifteen,"" he
 clacked. ""Tree floors down. Aer yu Amerikan?""


 ""Brazil.""


 ""Ah so? You sprikker goot Inglish laik me.""


 ""Very kind of you.""


 He rode down three floors, found room 615, and stopped as he heard
 voices within.


 ""...
dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, seis, siete
. By seven o'clock tonight,
 okay, Gringo?""


 ""What do you expect for seven thousand bucks—service? Look, boys, I'm
 just a honest businessman. I can't get it for you today. Have a seegar,
 Pablo.""


 ""Tfu!""


 ""All rightie, your cause is my cause. Maybe I can get it for you
 tonight. But you'll have to pay in advance. What do you say, Francisco?""


 ""I counted the money. It is waiting for you. You deliver, we pay.""


 ""But how can I trust you? I like you boys, I know you like me, but
 business is business. I gotta give something to my jobber, don't I?""


 ""Gringo!""


 At that moment Pashkov knocked on the door.


 From within: ""Shh!
Alguien llama a la puerta.
""


 Pashkov knocked again and a scuffle ensued within, the crack of a chair
 on a skull, the dragging of a beefy body into a closet, and the slam
 of the closet door.


 ""
Yu?
""


 ""
Buenas tardes
,"" Pashkov said through the door. ""
Asuntos muy
 importantes.
""


 The door opened a crack and two dark eyes in a young bearded face
 peered out. ""Eh?""


 ""
Gospodin Pashkov, para servir a usted.
""


 The door opened enough to admit the roly-poly visitor into the room.
 The other Cuban, also bearded and wearing a fatigue cap, held a
 revolver.


 ""No gun-play, caballeros,"" Pashkov went on in Spanish. ""We are in the
 Salvation Army charity house, not in a two-peso thriller. Besides, I
 deliver before I ask payment.""


 ""Deliver what, senor?""


 ""We favor any disturbance close to the United States. May I sit down?""


 Between two beds were stacked some dozen crates of explosives. A small
 table was littered with papers.


 Sitting down at the table, Pashkov's elbow rested on an invoice, and
 moments later the invoice was tucked in his pocket.


 ""What kind of ammunition do you need, caballeros?""


 The Cubans looked at each other. ""Thirty-o-six caliber, two-twenty
 grain. How much can you deliver?""


 ""Two thousand rounds.""


 ""Not much.""


 ""Maybe three thousand. I'll toss in a box of hand grenades and a can of
 lysergic acid diethylamide.""


 ""You have that? You have LSD-25?""


 ""I have that. When are you leaving Stockholm?""


 Again the young beards exchanged looks. ""Maybe we stay till tomorrow
 if you have more business. Three thousand rounds is not much. How much
 payment, senor?""


 ""Two thousand kronor,"" Pashkov said, taking an envelope on the table
 and addressing it to Nadezhda Brunhildova, Kremlin, Moscow. No return
 address.


 ""Do you trust us to send the money?""


 ""It is bad for you if I do not trust you,"" Pashkov said, smiling up at
 them.


 ""You can trust us. We shall send the money. Please take a cigar.""


 Pashkov took four Havanas from the box they held out to him, stuck
 three in his breast pocket, and lit one.


 ""You come again, senor. We make much business.""


 ""Why not? Help retire Latin-American dictators to Siberia. More gold in
 Siberia than in Las Vegas.""


 ""Hyi, hyi, that is funny. You come again.""


 On his way up to the roof, Pashkov studied the invoice he had lifted.
 It was from a manufacturer of sporting arms to Francisco Jesus Maria
 Gonzales, Salvation Army Economy Lodgings. He tucked the invoice into
 his inner pocket with a satisfied grunt, climbed into his flier and
 hopped over to Hotel Reisen, where Zubov's kidnaping team was waiting
 for him.
Comrade Zubov, the kidnaping expert, was pacing the roof of Hotel
 Reisen. As Pashkov eased down in his flier, Zubov's big front tooth
 flashed with delight. Pashkov felt like tossing him a bone.


 ""Everything in order, Gospodin Pashkov. Constant vigilance maintained
 at hospital by my two assistants. With your pardon, Comrade Petchareff
 urges all haste. Colonel James is due to leave the hospital tomorrow.""


 ""Comrade Petchareff always urges haste. What else?""


 Zubov's big tooth settled respectfully over his lower lip. His small
 eyes were so closely set that he looked cockeyed when he focused them
 on his superior.


 ""With your pardon, I shall conduct you to our suite. Plans for
 kidnaping of Colonel James all ready.""


 ""Here's a cigar for you.""


 ""Gratefully accepted. Reduced unavoidable fatalities to six."" Zubov
 counted on his long hard fingers. ""Two watchmen, three nurses, one
 doctor.""


 In the hotel corridor, Zubov looked before and after, his eyes crossed
 suspiciously, and peered around corners. They got to their suite
 without incident, and Pashkov gave him another cigar.


 ""Gratefully accepted. Here is a map of hospital and grounds. Here is a
 map of twenty-third floor. Here is a map of Colonel James' room. Here
 is hospital routine between midnight and dawn. With your pardon—""


 Pashkov picked up the phone, dialed the Soviet embassy, and got the
 chargé d'affaires. ""How is your underdeveloped countries fund?"" he
 asked.


 ""Always depleted, always replenished.""


 ""I don't want any Russian brands.""


 ""Nothing but foreign,"" the chargé buzzed. ""We got almost everything now
 through an American surplus outlet in Hamburg. Nationals get caught
 with American goods, Americans get blamed. Wonderful confusion. What do
 you need?""


 ""Thirty-o-six two-twenty, three thousand—if you have it.""


 ""Most popular. What else?""


 ""Pineapples—one crate.""


 ""Only confiscated German potatoes. Will that do?""


 ""Fine. And a small can of sentimental caviar.""


 ""Too risky.""


 ""It's all right. It will fall to local authorities by tomorrow.""


 Pashkov put down the receiver. Give the Cubans enough to expect
 more—make sure they stay in town.
Zubov was cross-checking his kidnaping plans. He said, ""With your
 pardon, do we take Colonel James alive or dead-or-alive?""


 ""Alive.""


 Zubov pulled a long face. ""Dead-or-alive would be easier, Gospodin
 Pashkov. Fast, clean job.""


 Pashkov squinted at Zubov's crossed eyes. ""Have you had your eyes
 examined lately?""


 ""No need,"" Zubov assured him with a smile. ""I see more than most
 people.""


 Pashkov held up his remaining cigar. ""How many cigars in my hand?""


 ""Two.""


 At that moment the door opened and Zubov's kidnaping team lumbered
 in. They were a couple of big apes dressed in blue canvas shoes, red
 trousers, yellow jackets, white silk scarves, sport caps and sun
 glasses.


 ""What are you doing here?"" cried Zubov. ""Why aren't you observing the
 hospital?""


 ""Dhh, you said to report ... um ... if something happened,"" the first
 ape said in a thick voice.


 ""Well?""


 ""Victim's room lights out,"" the ape said.


 ""My assistants,"" Zubov introduced them to Pashkov. ""Line up, line up,
 lads. With your pardon, they are good lads. This is Petya, and this is
 Kolya. No,
this
is Kolya and this one is Petya.""


 ""Twins?""


 ""Not exactly. Same genetic experiment. Good lads. Stand straight,
 Petya. Don't curl your feet like that, Kolya, I've told you before. Why
 didn't you shave your hands today?""


 Kolya looked guiltily at his hands.


 ""They've made progress,"" Zubov assured Pashkov, pulling a small whip
 from his hip pocket. ""Straight, lads, straight,"" he flicked the whip.
 ""We have company.""


 ""Are their costumes your own idea?""


 ""With your pardon, for purposes of concealment. What are your orders?""


 Pashkov told them to pick up the boxes of ammunition at the embassy and
 deliver them to the Cubans, and then to commandeer a private automobile.


 ""We have autos at the embassy pool,"" Zubov suggested.


 ""I want a vehicle off the street. Then report back here with your
 lads.""


 Petya gave Kolya a box on the ear.


 ""Boys, boys!"" Zubov cracked the whip. ""Out you go. A job for Gospodin
 Pashkov, lads. They don't get enough exercise,"" he grinned, backing out
 after them. ""With your pardon, I'll thrash them later.""


 And they were gone. Pashkov turned to the hospital maps and studied
 them before taking a nap.
Shortly before dawn, Zubov's team returned, their mission accomplished.


 ""With your pardon, an excellent Mercedes,"" Zubov reported.


 Pashkov had changed into the hospital gown with the Coca-Cola legend on
 the back. He glanced at his watch. It was four o'clock in the morning.


 He tossed his bundle of clothing to the first ape. ""Take my flier back
 to Moscow, Kolya lad. Give my clothes to Nadezhda Brunhildova, and tell
 Comrade Petchareff to expect Colonel James today.""


 Clutching the bundle, Kolya stuck his tongue out at Petya and bounded
 out of the room. They waited at the window until they saw Kolya take
 off in Pashkov's flier. Then they made their way down the service
 stairs to the alley, Pashkov dressed only in the hospital gown; got
 into the stolen Mercedes and drove to the National Hospital, all three
 leaning forward.


 In the ambulance court, Zubov and Petya moved quickly to a Red Cross
 flier. Pashkov dropped the invoice he had lifted from the Cubans on the
 front seat of the stolen car, and followed.


 A watchman emerged from his hut, looked idly up at the rising
 ambulance, and shuffled back to his morning coffee.


 As Petya brought the flier to a hovering stop against Colonel James'
 window, Pashkov bounced into the room; Zubov drew his gun and jumped in
 after.


 Colonel James awoke, turned on the night lamp, and sat up in the bed,
 his eyes blinking.


 Pashkov stood looking at Colonel James. The resemblance between them
 was remarkable. Zubov's eyes were crossed with astonishment.


 ""My dear Gospodin Pashkov!"" Colonel James greeted him in Russian,
 yawning. ""How kind of you to visit me. Do sit down."" Not only was his
 Russian good; his voice was a good imitation of Pashkov's voice.


 ""You're not really sick?"" Pashkov asked, sitting down on the bed.


 ""Not physically. But imagine my psychological condition. When I look
 in the mirror—"" The colonel shuddered.


 ""I hope your sacrifice won't be permanent?"" Pashkov said.


 ""That would be too much. How is my Russian? The truth, now.""


 ""Excellent. Put up your gun, Zubov. Colonel James and I don't get to
 talk very often.""


 ""And a pity we don't. Good manners accomplish more than an opera full
 of cloaks and daggers. Cigarette?""


 ""Gratefully accepted,"" Zubov said, slipping his gun into its holster
 with a flourish.
""Your treatment is over, then?"" Pashkov asked. ""You are ready for your
 assignment?""


 ""Ready.""


 ""And that is?""


 ""Delicate, very delicate. I must report to the Palace this morning.""


 ""Shall I kidnap him now?"" Zubov interrupted, puffing conceitedly on his
 cigarette.


 ""Mind your language, Zubov. May I ask, Colonel—do you want me to think
 I am falling into a trap?""


 ""No, no, my friend. I am only doing my best not to show my surprise at
 seeing you again."" The colonel got out of bed and sat down on Pashkov's
 other side.


 ""Zubov will make your trip to Moscow comfortable. All right, Zubov.""


 Zubov focused his crossed eyes on Pashkov.


 ""Take him straight to Petchareff,"" Colonel James said to Zubov. ""I'll
 report as soon as I know what these Swedes are up to.""


 Zubov seized Pashkov by the scruff of the neck and dragged him towards
 the window.


 ""Hold your claws, Zubov lad,"" Pashkov said. ""You have got the wrong
 man, can't you see?
That
is Colonel James.""


 ""Eh?""


 ""Use your eyes, blockhead.
I
am Pashkov.""


 Zubov did use his eyes. He looked from one to the other, and back. The
 more he focused, the more his eyes crossed. ""Eh?""


 Colonel James sat calmly on the bed. He said, ""Carry him out.""


 Zubov lifted Pashkov off the floor, crashed with his weight against the
 wall, but held on, grinned and staggered with Pashkov in his arms to
 the window.


 ""You miserable idiot,"" Pashkov shouted. ""You'll get a rest cure for
 this!""


 Zubov dropped him, pulled his gun and backed off into a corner. ""How
 can I tell you two apart just by looking!"" he cried hysterically. ""I'm
 not a learned man.""


 ""One small but decisive proof,"" Pashkov said, unbuttoning his hospital
 gown. ""I have a mole.""


 Zubov yanked the colonel up by an arm. ""Send
me
to rest cures, will
 you?""


 Colonel James sighed. ""I guess we have to keep up appearances,"" he
 muttered, and climbed out the window into the hovering ambulance. Zubov
 leaped in after, and they were off.
The suit of clothes hanging in the closet might have been Pashkov's
 own, identical with the clothes Kolya had taken to Moscow not an hour
 before. Even the underwear had facsimiles of the Order of Lenin sewn in.


 Satisfied, he crawled into the bed and fell into a pleasant snooze.


 He was awakened by the nurse, Anastina Bjorklund—alias Anastasia
 Semionovna Bezumnaya, formerly of the Stakhanovite Booster's Committee,
 Moscow Third Worker's District.


 ""Wonderful morning, Colonel James!""


 Petchareff seldom let one agent know what another was doing.


 She put a big breakfast tray on Pashkov's lap. ""Cloudy, damp, and
 windy. London stock market caves in, race riots in South Africa, famine
 in India, earthquake in Japan, floods in the United States, general
 strike in France, new crisis in Berlin. I ask you, what more can an
 idealist want?""


 ""Good morning, Miss Bjorklund.""


 The breakfast tray was crammed with a liter of orange juice, four
 boiled eggs, six slices of bacon, four pancakes, two pork chops, four
 slices of toast, a tumbler of vodka, a pot of coffee and two cigars.


 ""Ah, Colonel,"" Anastina said as Pashkov fell to, ""why did you let them
 change your face? It does not become you at all.""


 ""Part of my job. Don't you think I am more handsome now?""


 Anastina laughed shrilly. ""That bulbous nose handsome? What woman could
 fall in love with a nose like that?""


 ""It shows determination. I wish I had this nose permanently.""


 ""You mustn't talk like that. But I'll ignore your nose if you tell me
 more about White Sands Proving Grounds, as you promised.""


 ""With pleasure, with pleasure,"" he said, sinking his teeth into a pork
 chop, having seasoned the chop with the soft-boiled egg yolk. ""But
 right now I'm in a hurry to get to the Palace. Give my shoes an extra
 shine, there's a good girl.""


 ""Oh, you and your secrets!""


 An hour later, Pashkov landed on the Palace roof in Colonel James'
 flier—an exact copy of his own flier. The Palace roof captain stared
 at him, then smiled nervously.


 ""They are waiting for you in the Gustavus room, Colonel.""


 ""Colonel? Do I still look like Colonel James?""


 ""Oh, no, sir.""


 ""Do I talk like Colonel James?""


 ""You've changed completely, sir. If I didn't know, I would swear you
 were the notorious Gospodin Pashkov.""


 ""I am Gospodin Pashkov now, Captain. To everybody.""


 ""Of course, sir. I'll ring down you are coming.""


 Pashkov glanced at his watch. Colonel James would be landing in Moscow
 about now and taken to Comrade Petchareff for questioning.


 A manservant in velvet cutaways, patent leather shoes and white gloves,
 escorted Pashkov through rooms hung with chandeliers, tapestries,
 paintings. Pashkov entered the last room and stopped as the door
 clicked shut behind him.
In the room were three men, all of whom he recognized: Professor
 Kristin of the Swedish Academy, a white-haired old man with a kind,
 intelligent face; the king, Gustavus IX, a thin old man stroking his
 Vandyke, sitting under a portrait of Frederick the Great; and Monsieur
 Fanti, the make-up surgeon.


 Pashkov bowed his head. ""Your majesty. Gentlemen.""


 ""Extraordinary!"" Professor Kristin said.


 Pashkov turned to the surgeon. ""Monsieur, should my face have such a
 frivolous expression?""


 M. Fanti raised his eyebrows, but did not answer.


 ""I thought,"" said Pashkov, ""that Gospodin Pashkov's face has a more
 brutal look.""


 ""Propaganda,"" said the artist. But he came closer and looked at
 Pashkov's face with sudden interest.


 Professor Kristin said, ""Colonel James, we presume you have studied
 the problem in detail. I'm afraid we have delayed announcing the Nobel
 prize for literature much too long. How soon can you bring Boris
 Knackenpast to Stockholm?""


 So there it was: Boris Knackenpast a supreme success, as Pashkov had
 suspected. It would be amusing to tell robotist Medvedev about it.


 ""Delicate, very delicate,"" Pashkov said. ""Everything depends on my not
 running into Gospodin Pashkov.""


 ""We can't wait any longer,"" Professor Kristin said. ""Fortunately, we
 have an ally in the enemy camp. The robotist, Medvedev, is expecting
 you at Knackenpast's villa.""


 ""Bad show,"" M. Fanti said suddenly. ""No good. His left cheekbone is at
 least four centimeters too high.""


 The men looked at the surgeon, then at Pashkov.


 M. Fanti fingered Pashkov's cheekbone. ""How could I have made such a
 mistake! Just look at him. People laugh at such faces.""


 ""How much time to correct the error then, Monsieur Fanti?"" the king
 asked.


 ""A week at least. His skin needs a rest. I must rework the whole left
 side of his face—it's all lopsided.""


 ""But we can't spare a week,"" Professor Kristin said.


 ""With your majesty's permission,"" Pashkov offered, ""I am willing to go
 as I am. Indeed, my plans call for immediate departure.""


 ""It is a good thing you do for us, Colonel James,"" Gustavus IX said,
 ""and a courageous thing. Please accept our thanks.""


 Professor Kristin saw Pashkov to the door. ""One suggestion, Colonel.
 Your r's are still too soft for a real Russian. Why do you Americans
 slur them like that? And I beg you, if you value your life, do not fail
 to watch your fricatives.""
The roof captain saluted as Pashkov stepped out of the lift. His flier
 was serviced and ready.


 ""What weather in Moscow, Captain?""


 ""Ceiling four thousand. We're having patrols half way out to sea. They
 are instructed to let you pass.""


 A small incident, the roof captain explained. A Swedish Red Cross flier
 was missing from the National Hospital. Two Cuban agents had been
 arrested and a cache of small arms and ammunition was found. But no
 trace of the ambulance.


 ""I suppose the Cubans deny stealing the ambulance?"" Pashkov asked.


 ""They say they've been framed by a fat little Russian. But it's
 transparent, a clumsy job. Imagine, they left a stolen car in the
 ambulance court and in it an invoice for six cases of ammunition. It
 was traced to the Cubans in half an hour.""


 Pashkov climbed into his flier. ""Well, it's fashionable to blame the
 Russians for everything."" He waved his chubby hand, and took off.
 Flying over the Baltic, he set the controls on the Moscow beam.


 Ten minutes west of Moscow he tuned the communicator in on Petchareff's
 office.


 ""Seven One Three here, Nadezhda. Tell Petchareff—no, let me talk to
 him.""


 ""Seven One ... but that's impossible! Gospodin Pashkov is in conference
 with Comrade Petchareff.""


 ""Stupid!"" Petchareff's voice sounded behind Nadezhda's, and the speaker
 clicked and went dead.


 Pashkov dove into the clouds and brought his flier to a hovering stop.


 Petchareff did not believe he was Pashkov. Colonel James, it was clear,
 was at that moment in Petchareff's office, impersonating Pashkov. And
 Zubov was probably getting a rest cure.


 Pashkov crawled out of the cloud and skimmed northeast to Mir, Boris
 Knackenpast's villa.


 ""You came fast, sir,"" the lieutenant of guards welcomed him at Mir. ""We
 did not expect you for another fifteen minutes.""


 Fifteen minutes. The colonel was not wasting time.


 ""Listen carefully, lieutenant."" Pashkov described the American agent.
 ""But his left cheekbone is lower than mine—about four centimeters. He
 may be armed, so be careful.""


 The lieutenant stared. ""Shall we kill him?""


 ""No, no. Put him in a cage.""


 As Pashkov ran up the steps to the villa, the curtain in the vestibule
 window stirred. But when he entered, the vestibule was empty.


 He looked in the dining room, the music room, the library. Nobody.
 The house was strangely quiet. He came to the door of the study and
 listened. Not a sound. He went in and there, behind the large writing
 desk, sat Boris Knackenpast.


 The robot was unscrewing screws imbedded in his neck.


 ""My God, sir,"" said Pashkov, ""what are you doing?""
The robot's eyes, large disks of glittering mirror, flashed as he
 looked up. ""Ah, Colonel James,"" Boris said in a voice that seemed to
 come from a deep well. ""Excuse the poor welcome, but I understand we
 have little time. You scared my valet; he thought you were Gospodin
 Pashkov.""
The door burst open and Medvedev rushed in, the old valet at his heels.
 Medvedev stopped, gaped, then seized Pashkov's hand. ""Colonel James!
 What an artist, that Monsieur Fanti. But quick, Boris, Pashkov is on
 his way.""


 Boris pulled off his head, and crawled out of the robot shell. Pashkov
 saw Boris as he really was, a tall human with a gaunt, ascetic face.


 The sad thing about us, thought Pashkov, is that Medvedev could not
 trust even me. But then I could not trust Medvedev, either. Yes, that's
 the trouble with us.


 ""I hope you need no luggage, Mister Knackenpast,"" Pashkov said. ""We
 must be off at once.""


 ""Too late!"" the old valet said from the window.


 Colonel James had landed. But as he climbed down from his flier, the
 guards closed a circle about him.


 ""He'll keep,"" Pashkov said, hitching up his pants. ""Let's be off,
 Mister Knackenpast. It won't take long for Petchareff to smell us out.""


 ""Look!""


 The guards fell back from the flier and snapped to attention. Chewing
 on his cigar furiously, out stepped Petchareff.


 Zubov leaped out next, his big front tooth flashing. Then his two
 assistants, Petya and Kolya, tumbled out in their coats and hats. Last
 of all to emerge from the flier was Nadezhda Brunhildova.


 ""Pretend not to know me, will he?"" she yelled at Colonel James, picking
 up a rock.


 ""Hold it, citizenress,"" Colonel James said.


 ""Citizenress, is it?"" The rock flew over his head and felled Zubov.


 ""I warned you both, no kitchen squabbles while on duty,"" Petchareff
 roared. He snapped an order to the lieutenants of guards, and the
 guards surrounded the house.


 ""No alarm, no alarm,"" Pashkov said, pulling Boris away from the window.
 ""Mister Knackenpast, when you see your way clear to my flier, run for
 it. But get back into your robot costume.""


 ""I can't operate the machine.""


 ""I'll be right behind you. The rest of us will go out to Petchareff.""


 As they came out, Petchareff was reviving Zubov by slapping his face.
 The kidnaping expert lay stretched cold on the ground, and Nadezhda
 Brunhildova stood by, holding the rock and weeping.


 Colonel James said, ""There he is, the American spy.""


 Petchareff looked up as Pashkov was led forward by the guards. ""Not
 bad,"" Petchareff said. ""We could use Monsieur Fanti. What's his price?""


 ""Don't you know me, chief? Me, Pashkov.""


 ""Curse me,"" Nadezhda said, staring at him. ""Another Pashkov.""


 A terrible howl came from Zubov. Petya and Kolya, imitating
 Petchareff's efforts to revive their master, were battering Zubov's
 face with their slouched hats.


 ""Stand back!"" Kolya screamed, smashing his hat into Zubov's face. ""He
 is trying to say something!""


 ""He's moving!"" Petya kicked Zubov and looked up for approval, his hair
 standing up like spikes.


 Petchareff slapped Kolya's face and crushed the glowing end of his
 cigar on Petya's forehead. The apes reeled back to a tree.
Pashkov whispered to Colonel James.


 ""Capitalist hell and damnation, now I can't tell them apart myself,""
 Petchareff said. ""Zubov!""


 ""Hhng?""


 ""Which one's the real Pashkov?""


 ""Hhng?""


 But Colonel James was running to the flier, throwing Nadezhda's rock at
 Petchareff and running.


 ""Grenade!"" Pashkov yelled, and flung himself to the ground.


 At the same moment Boris Knackenpast ran from the house to the flier,
 his robot gear clattering like Don Quixote's armor.


 The guards scattered and dove for cover.


 ""Down, lads! Grenade!"" Pashkov yelled.


 The two apes took up the cry, ""Grenade, grenade!"" and flattened
 themselves behind the tree.


 Nadezhda and Medvedev collided, digging in behind the valet.


 Only Petchareff remained standing. ""Stop the robot!""


 Nobody moved.


 Boris reached the flier, Colonel James pulled him in, the engine
 hummed, and they were off. A moment later the flier vanished in the
 clouds towards Stockholm.


 Petchareff relit his cigar. ""Tfui, tastes of monkey hair.""


 Medvedev shambled over. ""Was the grenade a dud?""


 ""One of these days I'll catch you, Pashkov,"" Petchareff spat. ""Your
 deviousness, that's one thing. It could be useful. But your levity—""


 ""Darling!"" Nadezhda threw on Pashkov.


 ""Not in public,"" Pashkov said.


 ""Wait a minute,"" Petchareff said. ""Nadezhda Brunhildova, how do you
 know he really is Pashkov? If he's actually Colonel James, I can shoot
 him summarily. He
does
look like Colonel James to me.""


 ""But if you're mistaken?"" Medvedev put in nervously.


 ""We all make mistakes,"" Petchareff said. ""What would history be without
 mistakes?""


 ""I don't trust him either,"" Nadezhda said. ""But I know my Pashkov. If
 he's not Pashkov, I shall let you know in the morning.""

All she wanted was a mate and she had the gumption

 to go out and hunt one down. But that meant

 poaching in a strictly forbidden territory!
The best that could be said for Matilda Penshaws was that she was
 something of a paradox. She was thirty-three years old, certainly not
 aged when you consider the fact that the female life expectancy is now
 up in the sixties, but the lines were beginning to etch their permanent
 paths across her face and now she needed certain remedial undergarments
 at which she would have scoffed ten or even five years ago. Matilda was
 also looking for a husband.


 This, in itself, was not unusual—but Matilda was so completely
 wrapped up in the romantic fallacy of her day that she sought a prince
 charming, a faithful Don Juan, a man who had been everywhere and tasted
 of every worldly pleasure and who now wanted to sit on a porch and
 talk about it all to Matilda.


 The fact that in all probability such a man did not exist disturbed
 Matilda not in the least. She had been known to say that there are over
 a billion men in the world, a goodly percentage of whom are eligible
 bachelors, and that the right one would come along simply because she
 had been waiting for him.


 Matilda, you see, had patience.


 She also had a fetish. Matilda had received her A.B. from exclusive
 Ursula Johns College and Radcliff had yielded her Masters degree, yet
 Matilda was an avid follower of the pen pal columns. She would read
 them carefully and then read them again, looking for the masculine
 names which, through a system known only to Matilda, had an affinity
 to her own. To the gentlemen upon whom these names were affixed,
 Matilda would write, and she often told her mother, the widow Penshaws,
 that it was in this way she would find her husband. The widow Penshaws
 impatiently told her to go out and get dates.
That particular night, Matilda pulled her battered old sedan into the
 garage and walked up the walk to the porch. The widow Penshaws was
 rocking on the glider and Matilda said hello.


 The first thing the widow Penshaws did was to take Matilda's left hand
 in her own and examine the next-to-the-last finger.


 ""I thought so,"" she said. ""I knew this was coming when I saw that look
 in your eye at dinner. Where is Herman's engagement ring?""


 Matilda smiled. ""It wouldn't have worked out, Ma. He was too darned
 stuffy. I gave him his ring and said thanks anyway and he smiled
 politely and said he wished I had told him sooner because his fifteenth
 college reunion was this weekend and he had already turned down the
 invitation.""


 The widow Penshaws nodded regretfully. ""That was thoughtful of Herman
 to hide his feelings.""


 ""Hogwash!"" said her daughter. ""He has no true feelings. He's sorry that
 he had to miss his college reunion. That's all he has to hide. A stuffy
 Victorian prude and even less of a man than the others.""


 ""But, Matilda, that's your fifth broken engagement in three years. It
 ain't that you ain't popular, but you just don't want to cooperate.
 You don't
fall
in love, Matilda—no one does. Love osmoses into you
 slowly, without you even knowing, and it keeps growing all the time.""


 Matilda admired her mother's use of the word osmosis, but she found
 nothing which was not objectionable about being unaware of the impact
 of love. She said good-night and went upstairs, climbed out of her
 light summer dress and took a cold shower.


 She began to hum to herself. She had not yet seen the pen pal section
 of the current
Literary Review
, and because the subject matter of
 that magazine was somewhat highbrow and cosmopolitan, she could expect
 a gratifying selection of pen pals.


 She shut off the shower, brushed her teeth, gargled, patted herself
 dry with a towel, and jumped into bed, careful to lock the door of her
 bedroom. She dared not let the widow Penshaws know that she slept in
 the nude; the widow Penshaws would object to a girl sleeping in the
 nude, even if the nearest neighbor was three hundred yards away.


 Matilda switched her bed lamp on and dabbed some citronella on each
 ear lobe and a little droplet on her chin (how she hated insects!).
 Then she propped up her pillows—two pillows partially stopped her
 post-nasal drip; and took the latest issue of the
Literary Review
off the night table.


 She flipped through the pages and came to personals. Someone in
 Nebraska wanted to trade match books; someone in New York needed a
 midwestern pen pal, but it was a woman; an elderly man interested in
 ornithology wanted a young chick correspondent interested in the same
 subject; a young, personable man wanted an editorial position because
 he thought he had something to offer the editorial world; and—
Matilda read the next one twice. Then she held it close to the light
 and read it again. The
Literary Review
was one of the few magazines
 which printed the name of the advertiser rather than a box number, and
 Matilda even liked the sound of the name. But mostly, she had to admit
 to herself, it was the flavor of the wording. This very well could be
it
. Or, that is,
him
.


 Intelligent, somewhat egotistical male who's really been around, whose
 universal experience can make the average cosmopolite look like a
 provincial hick, is in need of several female correspondents: must be
 intelligent, have gumption, be capable of listening to male who has a
 lot to say and wants to say it. All others need not apply. Wonderful
 opportunity cultural experience ... Haron Gorka, Cedar Falls, Ill.


 The man was egotistical, all right; Matilda could see that. But she had
 never minded an egotistical man, at least not when he had something
 about which he had a genuine reason to be egotistical. The man sounded
 as though he would have reason indeed. He only wanted the best because
 he was the best. Like calls to like.


 The name—Haron Gorka: its oddness was somehow beautiful to Matilda.
 Haron Gorka—the nationality could be anything. And that was it. He had
 no nationality for all intents and purposes; he was an international
 man, a figure among figures, a paragon....


 Matilda sighed happily as she put out the light. The moon shone in
 through the window brightly, and at such times Matilda generally would
 get up, go to the cupboard, pull out a towel, take two hairpins from
 her powder drawer, pin the towel to the screen of her window, and hence
 keep the disturbing moonlight from her eyes. But this time it did not
 disturb her, and she would let it shine. Cedar Falls was a small town
 not fifty miles from her home, and she'd get there a hop, skip, and
 jump ahead of her competitors, simply by arriving in person instead of
 writing a letter.


 Matilda was not yet that far gone in years or appearance. Dressed
 properly, she could hope to make a favorable impression in person, and
 she felt it was important to beat the influx of mail to Cedar Falls.
Matilda got out of bed at seven, tiptoed into the bathroom, showered
 with a merest wary trickle of water, tiptoed back into her bedroom,
 dressed in her very best cotton over the finest of uplifting and
 figure-moulding underthings, made sure her stocking seams were
 perfectly straight, brushed her suede shoes, admired herself in the
 mirror, read the ad again, wished for a moment she were a bit younger,
 and tiptoed downstairs.


 The widow Penshaws met her at the bottom of the stairwell.


 ""Mother,"" gasped Matilda. Matilda always gasped when she saw something
 unexpected. ""What on earth are you doing up?""


 The widow Penshaws smiled somewhat toothlessly, having neglected to put
 in both her uppers and lowers this early in the morning. ""I'm fixing
 breakfast, of course....""


 Then the widow Penshaws told Matilda that she could never hope to sneak
 about the house without her mother knowing about it, and that even
 if she were going out in response to one of those foolish ads in the
 magazines, she would still need a good breakfast to start with like
 only mother could cook. Matilda moodily thanked the widow Penshaws.
Driving the fifty miles to Cedar Falls in a little less than an hour,
 Matilda hummed Mendelssohn's Wedding March all the way. It was her
 favorite piece of music. Once, she told herself: Matilda Penshaws, you
 are being premature about the whole thing. But she laughed and thought
 that if she was, she was, and, meanwhile, she could only get to Cedar
 Falls and find out.


 And so she got there.


 The man in the wire cage at the Cedar Falls post office was a
 stereotype. Matilda always liked to think in terms of stereotypes. This
 man was small, roundish, florid of face, with a pair of eyeglasses
 which hung too far down on his nose. Matilda knew he would peer over
 his glasses and answer questions grudgingly.


 ""Hello,"" said Matilda.


 The stereotype grunted and peered at her over his glasses. Matilda
 asked him where she could find Haron Gorka.


 ""What?""


 ""I said, where can I find Haron Gorka?""


 ""Is that in the United States?""


 ""It's not a that; it's a he. Where can I find him? Where does he live?
 What's the quickest way to get there?""


 The stereotype pushed up his glasses and looked at her squarely. ""Now
 take it easy, ma'am. First place, I don't know any Haron Gorka—""


 Matilda kept the alarm from creeping into her voice. She muttered an
oh
under her breath and took out the ad. This she showed to the
 stereotype, and he scratched his bald head. Then he told Matilda almost
 happily that he was sorry he couldn't help her. He grudgingly suggested
 that if it really were important, she might check with the police.


 Matilda did, only they didn't know any Haron Gorka, either. It turned
 out that no one did: Matilda tried the general store, the fire
 department, the city hall, the high school, all three Cedar Falls gas
 stations, the livery stable, and half a dozen private dwellings at
 random. As far us the gentry of Cedar Falls was concerned, Haron Gorka
 did not exist.


 Matilda felt bad, but she had no intention of returning home this
 early. If she could not find Haron Gorka, that was one thing; but she
 knew that she'd rather not return home and face the widow Penshaws, at
 least not for a while yet. The widow Penshaws meant well, but she liked
 to analyze other people's mistakes, especially Matilda's.


 Accordingly, Matilda trudged wearily toward Cedar Falls' small and
 unimposing library. She could release some of her pent-up aggression by
 browsing through the dusty slacks.


 This she did, but it was unrewarding. Cedar Falls had what might be
 called a microscopic library, and Matilda thought that if this small
 building were filled with microfilm rather than books, the library
 still would be lacking. Hence she retraced her steps and nodded to the
 old librarian as she passed.
Then Matilda frowned. Twenty years from now, this could be Matilda
 Penshaws—complete with plain gray dress, rimless spectacles, gray
 hair, suspicious eyes, and a broom-stick figure....


 On the other hand—why not? Why couldn't the librarian help her? Why
 hadn't she thought of it before? Certainly a man as well-educated as
 Haron Gorka would be an avid reader, and unless he had a permanent
 residence here in Cedar Palls, one couldn't expect that he'd have his
 own library with him. This being the case, a third-rate collection
 of books was far better than no collection at all, and perhaps the
 librarian would know Mr. Haron Gorka.


 Matilda cleared her throat. ""Pardon me,"" she began. ""I'm looking for—""


 ""Haron Gorka."" The librarian nodded.


 ""How on earth did you know?""


 ""That's easy. You're the sixth young woman who came here inquiring
 about that man today. Six of you—five others in the morning, and now
 you in the afternoon. I never did trust this Mr. Gorka....""


 Matilda jumped as if she had been struck strategically from the rear.
 ""You know him? You know Haron Gorka?""


 ""Certainly. Of course I know him. He's our steadiest reader here at
 the library. Not a week goes by that he doesn't take out three, four
 books. Scholarly gentleman, but not without charm. If I were twenty
 years younger—""


 Matilda thought a little flattery might be effective. ""Only ten,"" she
 assured the librarian. ""Ten years would be more than sufficient, I'm
 sure.""


 ""Are you? Well. Well, well."" The librarian did something with the back
 of her hair, but it looked the same as before. ""Maybe you're right.
 Maybe you're right at that."" Then she sighed. ""But I guess a miss is as
 good as a mile.""


 ""What do you mean?""


 ""I mean anyone would like to correspond with Haron Gorka. Or to know
 him well. To be considered his friend. Haron Gorka....""


 The librarian seemed about to soar off into the air someplace, and if
 five women had been here first, Matilda was now definitely in a hurry.


 ""Um, where can I find Mr. Gorka?""


 ""I'm not supposed to do this, you know. We're not permitted to give the
 addresses of any of our people. Against regulations, my dear.""


 ""What about the other five women?""


 ""They convinced me that I ought to give them his address.""


 Matilda reached into her pocket-book and withdrew a five dollar bill.
 ""Was this the way?"" she demanded. Matilda was not very good at this
 sort of thing.


 The librarian shook her head.


 Matilda nodded shrewdly and added a twin brother to the bill in her
 hand. ""Then is this better?""


 ""That's worse. I wouldn't take your money—""


 ""Sorry. What then?""


 ""If I can't enjoy an association with Haron Gorka directly, I still
 could get the vicarious pleasure of your contact with him. Report to me
 faithfully and you'll get his address. That's what the other five will
 do, and with half a dozen of you, I'll get an overall picture. Each one
 of you will tell me about Haron Gorka, sparing no details. You each
 have a distinct personality, of course, and it will color each picture
 considerably. But with six of you reporting, I should receive my share
 of vicarious enjoyment. Is it—ah—a deal?""


 Matilda assured her that it was, and, breathlessly, she wrote down the
 address. She thanked the librarian and then she went out to her car,
 whistling to herself.
Haron Gorka lived in what could have been an agrarian estate, except
 that the land no longer was being tilled. The house itself had fallen
 to ruin. This surprised Matilda, but she did not let it keep her
 spirits in check. Haron Gorka, the man, was what counted, and the
 librarian's account of him certainly had been glowing enough. Perhaps
 he was too busy with his cultural pursuits to pay any real attention to
 his dwelling. That was it, of course: the conspicuous show of wealth or
 personal industry meant nothing at all to Haron Gorka. Matilda liked
 him all the more for it.


 There were five cars parked in the long driveway, and now Matilda's
 made the sixth. In spite of herself, she smiled. She had not been the
 only one with the idea to visit Haron Gorka in person. With half a
 dozen of them there, the laggards who resorted to posting letters would
 be left far behind. Matilda congratulated herself for what she thought
 had been her ingenuity, and which now turned out to be something which
 she had in common with five other women. You live and learn, thought
 Matilda. And then, quite annoyedly, she berated herself for not having
 been the first. Perhaps the other five all were satisfactory; perhaps
 she wouldn't be needed; perhaps she was too late....
As it turned out, she wasn't. Not only that, she was welcomed with open
 arms. Not by Haron Gorka; that she really might have liked. Instead,
 someone she could only regard as a menial met her, and when he asked
 had she come in response to the advertisement, she nodded eagerly.
 He told her that was fine and he ushered her straight into a room
 which evidently was to be her living quarters. It contained a small
 undersized bed, a table, and a chair, and, near a little slot in the
 wall, there was a button.


 ""You want any food or drink,"" the servant told her, ""and you just press
 that button. The results will surprise you.""


 ""What about Mr. Gorka?""


 ""When he wants you, he will send for you. Meanwhile, make yourself to
 home, lady, and I will tell him you are here.""


 A little doubtful now, Matilda thanked him and watched him leave. He
 closed the door softly behind his retreating feet, but Matilda's ears
 had not missed the ominous click. She ran to the door and tried to open
 it, but it would not budge. It was locked—from the outside.


 It must be said to Matilda's favor that she sobbed only once. After
 that she realized that what is done is done and here, past thirty,
 she wasn't going to be girlishly timid about it. Besides, it was not
 her fault if, in his unconcern, Haron Gorka had unwittingly hired a
 neurotic servant.


 For a time Matilda paced back and forth in her room, and of what was
 going on outside she could hear nothing. In that case, she would
 pretend that there was nothing outside the little room, and presently
 she lay down on the bed to take a nap. This didn't last long, however:
 she had a nightmare in which Haron Gorka appeared as a giant with two
 heads, but, upon awaking with a start, she immediately ascribed that to
 her overwrought nerves.


 At that point she remembered what the servant had said about food and
 she thought at once of the supreme justice she could do to a juicy
 beefsteak. Well, maybe they didn't have a beefsteak. In that case, she
 would take what they had, and, accordingly, she walked to the little
 slot in the wall and pressed the button.


 She heard the whir of machinery. A moment later there was a soft
 sliding sound. Through the slot first came a delicious aroma, followed
 almost instantly by a tray. On the tray were a bowl of turtle soup,
 mashed potatoes, green peas, bread, a strange cocktail, root-beer, a
 parfait—and a thick tenderloin sizzling in hot butter sauce.
Matilda gasped once and felt about to gasp again—but by then her
 salivary glands were working overtime, and she ate her meal. The fact
 that it was precisely what she would have wanted could, of course, be
 attributed to coincidence, and the further fact that everything was
 extremely palatable made her forget all about Haron Gorka's neurotic
 servant.


 When she finished her meal a pleasant lethargy possessed her, and in a
 little while Matilda was asleep again. This time she did not dream at
 all. It was a deep sleep and a restful one, and when she awoke it was
 with the wonderful feeling that everything was all right.
The feeling did not last long. Standing over her was Haron Gorka's
 servant, and he said, ""Mr. Gorka will see you now.""


 ""Now?""


 ""Now. That's what you're here for, isn't it?""


 He had a point there, but Matilda hardly even had time to fix her hair.
 She told the servant so.


 ""Miss,"" he replied, ""I assure you it will not matter in the least to
 Haron Gorka. You are here and he is ready to see you and that is all
 that matters.""


 ""You sure?"" Matilda wanted to take no chances.


 ""Yes. Come.""


 She followed him out of the little room and across what should have
 been a spacious dining area, except that everything seemed covered with
 dust. Of the other women Matilda could see nothing, and she suddenly
 realized that each of them probably had a cubicle of a room like her
 own, and that each in her turn had already had her first visit with
 Haron Gorka. Well, then, she must see to it that she impressed him
 better than did all the rest, and, later, when she returned to tell the
 old librarian of her adventures, she could perhaps draw her out and
 compare notes.


 She would not admit even to herself that she was disappointed with
 Haron Gorka. It was not that he was homely and unimpressive; it was
 just that he was so
ordinary
-looking. She almost would have preferred
 the monster of her dreams.
He wore a white linen suit and he had mousy hair, drab eyes, an
 almost-Roman nose, a petulant mouth with the slight arch of the egotist
 at each corner.


 He said, ""Greetings. You have come—""


 ""In response to your ad. How do you do, Mr. Gorka?""


 She hoped she wasn't being too formal. But, then, there was no sense in
 assuming that he would like informality. She could only wait and see
 and adjust her own actions to suit him. Meanwhile, it would be best to
 keep on the middle of the road.


 ""I am fine. Are you ready?""


 ""Ready?""


 ""Certainly. You came in response to my ad. You want to hear me talk, do
 you not?""


 ""I—do."" Matilda had had visions of her prince charming sitting back
 and relaxing with her, telling her of the many things he had done and
 seen. But first she certainly would have liked to get to
know
the
 man. Well, Haron Gorka obviously had more experience along these lines
 than she did. He waited, however, as if wondering what to say, and
 Matilda, accustomed to social chatter, gave him a gambit.


 ""I must admit I was surprised when I got exactly what I wanted for
 dinner,"" she told him brightly.


 ""Eh? What say? Oh, yes, naturally. A combination of telepathy and
 teleportation. The synthetic cookery is attuned to your mind when you
 press the buzzer, and the strength of your psychic impulses determines
 how closely the meal will adjust to your desires. The fact that the
 adjustment here was near perfect is commendable. It means either that
 you have a high psi-quotient, or that you were very hungry.""


 ""Yes,"" said Matilda vaguely. Perhaps it might be better, after all, if
 Haron Gorka were to talk to her as he saw fit.


 ""Ready?""


 ""Uh—ready.""


 ""Well?""


 ""Well, what, Mr. Gorka?""


 ""What would you like me to talk about?""


 ""Oh, anything.""


 ""Please. As the ad read, my universal experience—is universal.
 Literally. You'll have to be more specific.""


 ""Well, why don't you tell me about some of your far travels?
 Unfortunately, while I've done a lot of reading, I haven't been to all
 the places I would have liked—""


 ""Good enough. You know, of course, how frigid Deneb VII is?""


 Matilda said, ""Beg pardon?""


 ""Well, there was the time our crew—before I had retired, of
 course—made a crash landing there. We could survive in the vac-suits,
 of course, but the
thlomots
were after us almost at once. They go
 mad over plastic. They will eat absolutely any sort of plastic. Our
 vac-suits—""
""—were made of plastic,"" Matilda suggested. She did not understand a
 thing he was talking about, but she felt she had better act bright.


 ""No, no. Must you interrupt? The air-hose and the water feed, these
 were plastic. Not the rest of the suit. The point is that half of us
 were destroyed before the rescue ship could come, and the remainder
 were near death. I owe my life to the mimicry of a
flaak
from Capella
 III. It assumed the properties of plastic and led the
thlomots
a
 merry chase across the frozen surface of D VII. You travel in the Deneb
 system now and Interstellar Ordinance makes it mandatory to carry
flaaks
with you. Excellent idea, really excellent.""
Almost at once, Matilda's educational background should have told her
 that Haron Gorka was mouthing gibberish. But on the other hand she
wanted
to believe in him and the result was that it took until now
 for her to realize it.


 ""Stop making fun of me,"" she said.


 ""So, naturally, you'll see
flaaks
all over that system—""


 ""Stop!""


 ""What's that? Making fun of you?"" Haron Gorka's voice had been so
 eager as he spoke, high-pitched, almost like a child's, and now he
 seemed disappointed. He smiled, but it was a sad smile, a smile of
 resignation, and he said, ""Very well. I'm wrong again. You are the
 sixth, and you're no better than the other five. Perhaps you are even
 more outspoken. When you see my wife, tell her to come back. Again she
 is right and I am wrong....""


 Haron Gorka turned his back.


 Matilda could do nothing but leave the room, walk back through the
 house, go outside and get into her car. She noticed not without
 surprise that the other five cars were now gone. She was the last of
 Haron Gorka's guests to depart.


 As she shifted into reverse and pulled out of the driveway, she saw
 the servant leaving, too. Far down the road, he was walking slowly.
 Then Haron Gorka had severed that relationship, too, and now he was all
 alone.


 As she drove back to town, the disappointment melted slowly away. There
 were, of course, two alternatives. Either Haron Gorka was an eccentric
 who enjoyed this sort of outlandish tomfoolery, or else he was plainly
 insane. She could still picture him ranting on aimlessly to no one in
 particular about places which had no existence outside of his mind, his
 voice high-pitched and eager.
It was not until she had passed the small library building that she
 remembered what she had promised the librarian. In her own way, the
 aging woman would be as disappointed as Matilda, but a promise was a
 promise, and Matilda turned the car in a wide U-turn and parked it
 outside the library.


 The woman sat at her desk as Matilda had remembered her, gray,
 broom-stick figure, rigid. But now when she saw Matilda she perked up
 visibly.


 ""Hello, my dear,"" she said.


 ""Hi.""


 ""You're back a bit sooner than I expected. But, then, the other five
 have returned, too, and I imagine your story will be similar.""


 ""I don't know what they told you,"" Matilda said. ""But this is what
 happened to me.""


 She quickly then related everything which had happened, completely and
 in detail. She did this first because it was a promise, and second
 because she knew it would make her feel better.


 ""So,"" she finished, ""Haron Gorka is either extremely eccentric or
 insane. I'm sorry.""


 ""He's neither,"" the librarian contradicted. ""Perhaps he is slightly
 eccentric by your standards, but really, my dear, he is neither.""


 ""What do you mean?""


 ""Did he leave a message for his wife?""


 ""Why, yes. Yes, he did. But how did you know? Oh, I suppose he told the
 five.""


 ""No. He didn't. But you were the last and I thought he would give you a
 message for his wife—""


 Matilda didn't understand. She didn't understand at all, but she told
 the little librarian what the message was. ""He wanted her to return,""
 she said.


 The librarian nodded, a happy smile on her lips. ""You wouldn't believe
 me if I told you something.""


 ""What's that?""


 ""I am Mrs. Gorka.""


 The librarian stood up and came around the desk. She opened a drawer
 and took out her hat and perched it jauntily atop her gray hair. ""You
 see, my dear, Haron expects too much. He expects entirely too much.""


 Matilda did not say a word. One madman a day would be quite enough for
 anybody, but here she found herself confronted with two.


 ""We've been tripping for centuries, visiting every habitable star
 system from our home near Canopus. But Haron is too demanding. He
 says I am a finicky traveler, that he could do much better alone, the
 accommodations have to be just right for me, and so forth. When he
 loses his temper, he tries to convince me that any number of females of
 the particular planet would be more than thrilled if they were given
 the opportunity just to listen to him.


 ""But he's wrong. It's a hard life for a woman. Someday—five thousand,
 ten thousand years from now—I will convince him. And then we will
 settle down on Canopus XIV and cultivate
torgas
. That would be so
 nice—""


 ""I'm sure.""


 ""Well, if Haron wants me back, then I have to go. Have a care, my dear.
 If you marry, choose a home-body. I've had the experience and you've
 seen my Haron for yourself.""


 And then the woman was gone. Numbly, Matilda walked to the doorway and
 watched her angular figure disappear down the road. Of all the crazy
 things....


 Deneb and Capella and Canopus, these were stars. Add a number and you
 might have a planet revolving about each star. Of all the insane—


 They were mad, all right, and now Matilda wondered if, actually,
 they were husband and wife. It could readily be; maybe the madness
 was catching. Maybe if you thought too much about such things, such
 travels, you could get that way. Of course, Herman represented the
 other extreme, and Herman was even worse in his own way—but hereafter
 Matilda would seek the happy medium.


 And, above all else, she had had enough of her pen pal columns. They
 were, she realized, for kids.
She ate dinner in Cedar Falls and then she went out to her car again,
 preparing for the journey back home. The sun had set and it was a clear
 night, and overhead the great broad sweep of the Milky Way was a pale
 rainbow bridge in the sky.


 Matilda paused. Off in the distance there was a glow on the horizon,
 and that was the direction of Haron Gorka's place.


 The glow increased; soon it was a bright red pulse pounding on the
 horizon. It flickered. It flickered again, and finally it was gone.


 The stars were white and brilliant in the clear country air. That was
 why Matilda liked the country better than the city, particularly on a
 clear summer night when you could see the span of the Milky Way.


 But abruptly the stars and the Milky Way were paled by the brightest
 shooting star Matilda had ever seen. It flashed suddenly and it
 remained in view for a full second, searing a bright orange path across
 the night sky.


 Matilda gasped and ran into her car. She started the gears and pressed
 the accelerator to the floor, keeping it there all the way home.


 It was the first time she had ever seen a shooting star going
up

""That all, chief? Gonna quit now?""


 Brian Hanson looked disgustedly at Pete Brent, his lanky assistant.
 That was the first sign of animation he had displayed all day.


 ""I am, but you're not,"" Hanson told him grimly. ""Get your notes
 straightened up. Run those centrifuge tests and set up the still so we
 can get at that vitamin count early in the morning.""


 ""Tomorrow morning? Aw, for gosh sakes, chief, why don't you take a day
 off sometime, or better yet, a night off. It'd do you good to relax.
 Boy, I know a swell blonde you could go for. Wait a minute, I've got
 her radiophone number somewhere—just ask for Myrtle.""


 Hanson shrugged himself out of his smock.


 ""Never mind Myrtle, just have that equipment set up for the morning.
 Good night."" He strode out of the huge laboratory, but his mind was
 still on the vitamin research they had been conducting, he barely heard
 the remarks that followed him.


 ""One of these days the chief is going to have his glands catch up with
 him.""


 ""Not a chance,"" Pete Brent grunted.


 Brian Hanson wondered dispassionately for a moment how his assistants
 could fail to be as absorbed as he was by the work they were doing,
 then he let it go as he stepped outside the research building.


 He paused and let his eyes lift to the buildings that surrounded the
 compound. This was the administrative heart of Venus City. Out here,
 alone, he let his only known emotion sweep through him, pride. He had
 an important role in the building of this great new city. As head of
 the Venus Consolidated Research Organization, he was in large part
 responsible for the prosperity of this vigorous, young world. Venus
 Consolidated had built up this city and practically everything else
 that amounted to anything on this planet. True, there had been others,
 pioneers, before the company came, who objected to the expansion of the
 monopolistic control. But, if they could not realize that the company's
 regime served the best interests of the planet, they would just have to
 suffer the consequences of their own ignorance. There had been rumors
 of revolution among the disgruntled older families.


 He heard there had been killings, but that was nonsense. Venus
 Consolidated police had only powers of arrest. Anything involving
 executions had to be referred to the Interplanetary Council on Earth.
 He dismissed the whole business as he did everything else that did not
 directly influence his own department.


 He ignored the surface transport system and walked to his own
 apartment. This walk was part of a regular routine of physical exercise
 that kept his body hard and resilient in spite of long hours spent in
 the laboratory. As he opened the door of his apartment he heard the
 water running into his bath. Perfect timing. He was making that walk
 in precisely seven minutes, four and four-fifths seconds. He undressed
 and climbed into the tub, relaxing luxuriously in the exhilaration of
 irradiated water.


 He let all the problems of his work drift away, his mind was a peaceful
 blank. Then someone was hammering on his head. He struggled reluctantly
 awake. It was the door that was being attacked, not his head. The
 battering thunder continued persistently. He swore and sat up.


 ""What do you want?""


 There was no answer; the hammering continued.


 ""All right! All right! I'm coming!"" He yelled, crawled out of the tub
 and reached for his bathrobe. It wasn't there. He swore some more and
 grabbed a towel, wrapping it inadequately around him; it didn't quite
 meet astern. He paddled wetly across the floor sounding like a flock of
 ducks on parade.


 Retaining the towel with one hand he inched the door cautiously open.


 ""What the devil—"" He stopped abruptly at the sight of a policeman's
 uniform.


 ""Sorry, sir, but one of those rebels is loose in the Administration
 Center somewhere. We're making a check-up of all the apartments.""


 ""Well, you can check out; I haven't got any blasted rebels in here.""
 The policeman's face hardened, then relaxed knowingly.


 ""Oh, I see, sir. No rebels, of course. Sorry to have disturbed you.
 Have a good—Good night, sir,"" he saluted and left.


 Brian closed the door in puzzlement. What the devil had that flat-foot
 been smirking about? Well, maybe he could get his bath now.
Hanson turned away from the door and froze in amazement. Through the
 open door of his bedroom he could see his bed neatly turned down as
 it should be, but the outline under the counterpane and the luxuriant
 mass of platinum-blond hair on the pillow was certainly no part of his
 regular routine.


 ""Hello."" The voice matched the calm alertness of a pair of deep-blue
 eyes. Brian just stared at her in numbed fascination. That was what the
 policeman had meant with his insinuating smirk.


 ""Just ask for Myrtle."" Pete Brent's joking words flashed back to him.
 Now he got it. This was probably the young fool's idea of a joke. He'd
 soon fix that.


 ""All right, joke's over, you can beat it now.""


 ""Joke? I don't see anything funny, unless it's you and that suggestive
 towel. You should either abandon it or get one that goes all the way
 round.""


 Brian slowly acquired a complexion suitable for painting fire plugs.


 ""Shut up and throw me my dressing gown."" He gritted.


 The girl swung her legs out of bed and Brian blinked; she was fully
 dressed. The snug, zippered overall suit she wore did nothing to
 conceal the fact that she was a female. He wrapped his bathrobe
 austerely around him.


 ""Well, now what?"" she asked and looked at him questioningly.


 ""Well, what do you think?"" he burst out angrily. ""I'm going to finish
 my bath and I'd suggest you go down to the laboratory and hold hands
 with Pete. He'd appreciate it."" He got the impression that the girl was
 struggling heroically to refrain from laughing and that didn't help his
 dignity any. He strode into the bathroom, slammed the door and climbed
 back into the bath.


 The door opened a little.


 ""Well, good-by now."" The girl said sweetly. ""Remember me to the police
 force.""


 ""Get out of here!"" he yelled and the door shut abruptly on a rippling
 burst of laughter. Damn women! It was getting so a man had to pack
 a gun with him or something. And Pete Brent. He thought with grim
 satisfaction of the unending extra work that was going to occur around
 the laboratory from now on. He sank back into the soothing liquid
 embrace of the bath and deliberately set his mind loose to wander in
 complete relaxation.


 A hammering thunder burst on the outer door. He sat up with a groan.


 ""Lay off, you crazy apes!"" he yelled furiously, but the pounding
 continued steadily. He struggled out of the bath, wrapped his damp
 bathrobe clammily around him and marched to the door with a seething
 fury of righteous anger burning within him. He flung the door wide, his
 mouth all set for a withering barrage, but he didn't get a chance. Four
 police constables and a sergeant swarmed into the room, shoving him
 away from the door.


 ""Say! What the—""


 ""Where is she?"" the sergeant demanded.


 ""Wherethehell's who?""


 ""Quit stallin', bud. You know who. That female rebel who was in here.""


 ""Rebel? You're crazy! That was just ... Pete said ... rebel? Did you
 say rebel?""


 ""Yeah, I said rebel, an' where is she?""


 ""She ... why ... why ... she left, of course. You don't think I was
 going to have women running around in here, do you?""


 ""She wuz in his bed when I seen her, sarge,"" one of the guards
 contributed. ""But she ain't there now.""


 ""You don't think that I—""


 ""Listen, bud, we don't do the thinkin' around here. You come on along
 and see the chief.""


 Brian had had about enough. ""I'm not going anywhere to see anybody.
 Maybe you don't know who I am. You can't arrest me.""
Brian Hanson, Chief of Research for Venus Consolidated, as dignified as
 possible in a damp bathrobe, glared out through the bars at a slightly
 bewildered Pete Brent.


 ""What the devil do you want? Haven't you caused enough blasted trouble
 already?""


 ""Me? For gosh sakes, chief—""


 ""Yes, you! If sending that damn blonde to my apartment and getting me
 arrested is your idea of a joke—""


 ""But, my gosh, I didn't send anybody, chief. And this is no joke.
 That wasn't Myrtle, that was Crystal James, old man James' daughter.
 They're about the oldest family on Venus. Police have been after her
 for months; she's a rebel and she's sure been raising plenty of hell
 around here. She got in and blew out the main communications control
 panel last night. Communications been tied up all day."" Pete lowered
 his voice to an appreciative whisper, ""Gosh, chief, I didn't know you
 had it in you. How long have you been in with that bunch? Is that girl
 as good-looking as they say she is?""


 ""Now listen here, Brent. I don't know—""


 ""Oh, it's all right, chief. You can trust me. I won't give you away.""


 ""There's nothing to give away, you fool!"" Brian bellowed. ""I don't know
 anything about any damn rebels. All I want is to get out of here—""


 ""Gotcha, chief,"" Brent whispered understandingly. ""I'll see if I can
 pass the word along.""


 ""Come here, you idiot!"" Brian screamed after his erstwhile assistant.


 ""Pipe down there, bud,"" a guard's voice cut in chillingly.


 Brian retired to his cell bunk and clutched his aching head in
 frustrated fury.


 For the nineteenth time Brian Hanson strode to the door of his cell and
 rattled the bars.


 ""Listen here, guard, you've got to take a message to McHague. You can't
 hold me here indefinitely.""


 ""Shut up. Nobody ain't takin' no message to McHague. I don't care if
 you are—""


 Brian's eyes almost popped out as he saw a gloved hand reach around
 the guard's neck and jam a rag over his nose and mouth. Swift shadows
 moved expertly before his astonished gaze. Another guard was caught and
 silenced as he came around the end of the corridor. Someone was outside
 his cell door, a hooded figure which seemed, somehow, familiar.


 ""Hello, pantless!"" a voice breathed.


 He knew that voice!


 ""What the devil are you doing here?""


 ""Somebody by the name of Pete Brent tipped us off that you were in
 trouble because of me. But don't worry, we're going to get you out.""


 ""Damn that fool kid! Leave me alone. I don't want to get out of here
 that way!"" he yelled wildly. ""Guards! Help!""


 ""Shut up! Do you want to get us shot?""


 ""Sure I do. Guards! Guards!""


 Someone came running.


 ""Guards are coming,"" a voice warned.


 He could hear the girl struggling with the lock.


 ""Damn,"" she swore viciously. ""This is the wrong key! Your goose is sure
 cooked now. Whether you like it or not, you'll hang with us when they
 find us trying to get you out of here.""


 Brian felt as though something had kicked him in the stomach. She was
 right! He had to get out now. He wouldn't be able to explain this away.


 ""Give me that key,"" he hissed and grabbed for it.


 He snapped two of the coigns off in the lock and went to work with the
 rest of the key. He had designed these escape-proof locks himself. In a
 few seconds the door swung open and they were fleeing silently down the
 jail corridor.


 The girl paused doubtfully at a crossing passage.


 ""This way,"" he snarled and took the lead. He knew the ground plan of
 this jail perfectly. He had a moment of wonder at the crazy spectacle
 of himself, the fair-haired boy of Venus Consolidated, in his flapping
 bathrobe, leading a band of escaping rebels out of the company's best
 jail.


 They burst around a corner onto a startled guard.


 ""They're just ahead of us,"" Brian yelled. ""Come on!""


 ""Right with you,"" the guard snapped and ran a few steps with them
 before a blackjack caught up with him and he folded into a corner.


 ""Down this way, it's a short cut."" Brian led the way to a heavily
 barred side door.


 The electric eye tripped a screaming alarm, but the broken key in
 Brian's hands opened the complicated lock in a matter of seconds. They
 were outside the jail on a side street, the door closed and the lock
 jammed immovably behind them.


 Sirens wailed. The alarm was out! The street suddenly burst into
 brilliance as the floodlights snapped on. Brian faltered to a stop and
 Crystal James pushed past him.


 ""We've got reinforcements down here,"" she said, then skidded to a halt.
 Two guards barred the street ahead of them.


 Brian felt as though his stomach had fallen down around his ankles
 and was tying his feet up. He couldn't move. The door was jammed shut
 behind them, they'd have to surrender and there'd be no explaining
 this break. He started mentally cursing Pete Brent, when a projector
 beam slashed viciously by him. These guards weren't fooling! He heard
 a gasping grunt of pain as one of the rebels went down. They were
 shooting to kill.


 He saw a sudden, convulsive movement from the girl. A black object
 curved out against the lights. The sharp, ripping blast of an atomite
 bomb thundered along the street and slammed them to the ground. The
 glare left them blinded. He struggled to his feet. The guards had
 vanished, a shallow crater yawned in the road where they had been.


 ""We've got to run!"" the girl shouted.


 He started after her. Two surface transport vehicles waited around the
 corner. Brian and the rebels bundled into them and took away with a
 roar. The chase wasn't organized yet, and they soon lost themselves in
 the orderly rush of Venus City traffic.
The two carloads of rebels cruised nonchalantly past the Administration
 Center and pulled into a private garage a little beyond.


 ""What are we stopping here for?"" Brian demanded. ""We've got to get
 away.""


 ""That's just what we're doing,"" Crystal snapped. ""Everybody out.""


 The rebels piled out and the cars pulled away to become innocuous parts
 of the traffic stream. The rebels seemed to know where they were going
 and that gave them the edge on Brian. They followed Crystal down into
 the garage's repair pit.


 She fumbled in the darkness a moment, then a darker patch showed as
 a door swung open in the side of the pit. They filed into the solid
 blackness after her and the door thudded shut. The beam of a torch
 stabbed through the darkness and they clambered precariously down a
 steep, steel stairway.


 ""Where the dickens are we?"" Brian whispered hoarsely.


 ""Oh, you don't have to whisper, we're safe enough here. This is one of
 the air shafts leading down to the old mines.""


 ""Old mines? What old mines?""


 ""That's something you newcomers don't know anything about. This whole
 area was worked out long before Venus Consolidated came to the planet.
 These old tunnels run all under the city.""


 They went five hundred feet down the air shaft before they reached a
 level tunnel.


 ""What do we do? Hide here?""


 ""I should say not. Serono Zeburzac, head of McHague's secret police
 will be after us now. We won't be safe anywhere near Venus City.""


 ""Don't be crazy. That Serono Zeburzac stuff is just a legend McHague
 keeps up to scare people with.""


 ""That's what you think,"" Crystal snapped. ""McHague's legend got my
 father and he'll get all of us unless we run the whole company right
 off the planet.""


 ""Well, what the dickens does he look like?"" Brian asked doubtfully.


 ""I don't know, but his left hand is missing. Dad did some good shooting
 before he died,"" she said grimly.


 Brian was startled at the icy hardness of her voice.


 Two of the rebels pulled a screening tarpaulin aside and revealed
 one of the old-type ore cars that must have been used in the ancient
 mines. A brand-new atomic motor gleamed incongruously at one end. The
 rebels crowded into it and they went rumbling swiftly down the echoing
 passage. The lights of the car showed the old working, rotten and
 crumbling, fallen in in some places and signs of new work where the
 rebels had cleared away the debris of years.


 Brian struggled into a zippered overall suit as they followed a
 twisting, tortuous course for half an hour, switching from one tunnel
 to another repeatedly until he had lost all conception of direction.
 Crystal James, at the controls, seemed to know exactly where they were
 going.


 The tunnel emerged in a huge cavern that gloomed darkly away in every
 direction. The towering, massive remains of old machinery, eroded and
 rotten with age crouched like ancient, watching skeletons.


 ""These were the old stamp mills,"" the girl said, and her voice seemed
 to be swallowed to a whisper in the vast, echoing darkness.


 Between two rows of sentinel ruins they came suddenly on two slim
 Venusian atmospheric ships. Dim light spilled over them from a ragged
 gash in the wall of the cavern. Brian followed Crystal into the smaller
 of the two ships and the rest of the rebels manned the other.


 ""Wait a minute, how do we get out of here?"" Brian demanded.


 ""Through that hole up there,"" the girl said matter-of-factly.


 ""You're crazy, you can't get through there.""


 ""Oh, yeah? Just watch this."" The ship thundered to life beneath them
 and leaped off in a full-throttled take-off.


 ""We're going to crash! That gap isn't wide enough!""


 The sides of the gap rushed in on the tips of the stubby wings. Brian
 braced himself for the crash, but it didn't come. At the last possible
 second, the ship rolled smoothly over. At the moment it flashed through
 the opening it was stood vertically on edge.
Crystal held the ship in its roll and completed the maneuver outside
 the mountain while Brian struggled to get his internal economy back
 into some semblance of order.


 ""That's some flying,"" he said as soon as he could speak.


 Crystal looked at him in surprise. ""That's nothing. We Venusians fly
 almost as soon as we can walk.""


 ""Oh—I see,"" Brian said weakly and a few moments later he really did
 see. Two big, fast, green ships, carrying the insignia of the Venus
 Consolidated police, cruised suddenly out from a mountain air station.


 An aërial torpedo exploded in front of the rebel ship. Crystal's face
 set in grim lines as she pulled the ship up in a screaming climb. Brian
 got up off the floor.


 ""You don't have to get excited like that,"" he complained. ""They weren't
 trying to hit us.""


 ""That's what you think,"" Crystal muttered. ""Those children don't play
 for peanuts.""


 ""But, girl, they're just Venus Consolidated police. They haven't got
 any authority to shoot anyone.""


 ""Authority doesn't make much difference to them,"" Crystal snapped
 bitterly. ""They've been killing people all over the planet. What do you
 think this revolution is about?""


 ""You must be mistak—"" He slumped to the floor as Crystal threw the
 ship into a mad, rolling spin. A tremendous crash thundered close
 astern.


 ""I guess that was a mistake!"" Crystal yelled as she fought the controls.


 Brian almost got to his feet when another wild maneuver hurled him back
 to the floor. The police ship was right on their tail. The girl gunned
 her craft into a snap Immelmann and swept back on their pursuers,
 slicing in close over the ship. Brian's eyes bulged as he saw a long
 streak of paint and metal ripped off the wing of the police ship. He
 saw the crew battling their controls in startled terror. The ship
 slipped frantically away and fell into a spin.


 ""That's them,"" Crystal said with satisfaction. ""How are the others
 doing?""


 ""Look! They're hit!"" Brian felt sick.
The slower rebel freight ship staggered drunkenly as a torpedo caught
 it and ripped away half a wing. It plunged down in flames with the
 white flowers of half a dozen parachutes blossoming around it. Brian
 watched in horror as the police ship came deliberately about. They
 heard its forward guns go into action. The bodies of the parachutists
 jerked and jumped like crazy marionettes as the bullets smashed into
 them. It was over in a few moments. The dead rebels drifted down into
 the mist-shrouded depths of the valley.


 ""The dirty, murdering rats!"" Brian's voice ripped out in a fury of
 outrage. ""They didn't have a chance!""


 ""Don't get excited,"" Crystal told him in a dead, flat voice. ""That's
 just normal practice. If you'd stuck your nose out of your laboratory
 once in a while, you'd have heard of these things.""


 ""But why—"" He ducked away instinctively as a flight of bullets spanged
 through the fuselage. ""They're after us now!""


 Crystal's answer was to yank the ship into a rocketing climb. The
 police were watching for that. The big ship roared up after them.


 ""Just follow along, suckers,"" Crystal invited grimly.


 She snapped the ship into a whip stall. For one nauseating moment they
 hung on nothing, then the ship fell over on its back and they screamed
 down in a terminal velocity dive, heading for the safety of the lower
 valley mists. The heavier police ship, with its higher wing-loading,
 could not match the maneuver. The rebel craft plunged down through the
 blinding fog. Half-seen, ghostly fingers of stone clutched up at them,
 talons of gray rock missed and fell away again as Crystal nursed the
 ship out of its dive.


 ""
Phew!
"" Brian gasped. ""Well, we got away that time. How in thunder
 can you do it?""


 ""Well, you don't do it on faith. Take a look at that fuel gauge! We
 may get as far as our headquarters—or we may not.""
For twenty long minutes they groped blindly through the fog, flying
 solely by instruments and dead reckoning. The needle of the fuel gauge
 flickered closer and closer to the danger point. They tore loose from
 the clinging fog as it swung firmly to ""Empty."" The drive sputtered and
 coughed and died.


 ""That's figuring it nice and close,"" Crystal said in satisfaction. ""We
 can glide in from here.""


 ""Into where?"" Brian demanded. All he could see immediately ahead was
 the huge bulk of a mountain which blocked the entire width of the
 valley and soared sheer up to the high-cloud level. His eyes followed
 it up and up—


 ""Look! Police ships. They've seen us!""


 ""Maybe they haven't. Anyway, there's only one place we can land.""


 The ship lunged straight for the mountain wall!


 ""Are you crazy? Watch out—we'll crash!""


 ""You leave the flying to me,"" Crystal snapped.


 She held the ship in its glide, aiming directly for the tangled foliage
 of the mountain face. Brian yelped and cowered instinctively back. The
 lush green of the mountainside swirled up to meet them. They ripped
 through the foliage—there was no crash. They burst through into a
 huge, brilliantly lighted cavern and settled to a perfect landing. Men
 came running. Crystal tumbled out of her ship.


 ""Douse those lights,"" she shouted. ""The police are outside.""


 A tall, lean man with bulbous eyes and a face like a startled horse,
 rushed up to Crystal.


 ""What do you mean by leading them here?"" he yelled, waving his hands.


 ""They jumped us when we had no fuel, and quit acting like an idiot.""


 The man was shaking, his eyes looked wild. ""They'll kill us. We've got
 to get out of here.""


 ""Wait, you fool. They may not even have seen us."" But he was gone,
 running toward a group of ships lined up at the end of the cavern.


 ""Who was that crazy coot and what is this place?"" Brian demanded.


 ""That was Gort Sterling, our leader,"" the girl said bitterly. ""And
 this is our headquarters."" One of the ships at the back of the cavern
 thundered to life, streaked across the floor and burst out through the
 opening Crystal's ship had left. ""He hasn't got a chance! We'll be
 spotted for sure, now.""


 The other rebels waited uncertainly, but not for long. There was the
 crescendoing roar of ships in a dive followed by the terrific crash of
 an explosion.


 ""They got him!"" Crystal's voice was a moan. ""Oh, the fool, the fool!""


 ""Sounded like more than one ship. They'll be after us, now. Is there
 any other way of getting out of this place?""


 ""Not for ships. We'll have to walk and they'll follow us.""


 ""We've got to slow them down some way, then. I wonder how the devil
 they traced us? I thought we lost them in that fog.""


 ""It's that Serono Zeburzac, the traitor. He knows these mountains as
 well as we do.""


 ""How come?""


 ""The Zeburzacs are one of the old families, but he sold out to McHague.""


 ""Well, what do we do now? Just stand here? It looks like everybody's
 leaving.""


 ""We might as well just wait,"" Crystal said hopelessly. ""It won't do us
 any good to run out into the hills. Zeburzac and his men will follow.""


 ""We could slow them down some by swinging a couple of those ships
 around so their rocket exhausts sweep the entrance to the cavern,""
 Brian suggested doubtfully. She looked at him steadily.


 ""You sound like the only good rebel left. We can try it, anyway.""
They ran two ships out into the middle of the cavern, gunned them
 around and jockeyed them into position—not a moment too soon.


 Half a dozen police showed in brief silhouette as they slipped
 cautiously into the cavern, guns ready, expecting resistance. They met
 a dead silence. A score or more followed them without any attempt at
 concealment. Then Brian and Crystal cut loose with the drives of the
 two ships.


 Startled screams of agony burst from the crowded group of police as
 they were caught in the annihilating cross fire of roaring flame.
 They crisped and twisted, cooked to scorched horrors before they
 fell. A burst of thick, greasy smoke rushed out of the cavern. Two of
 the police, their clothes and flesh scorched and flaming, plunged as
 shrieking, living torches down the mountainside.


 Crystal was white and shaking, her face set in a mask of horror, as she
 climbed blindly from her ship.


 ""Let's get away! I can smell them burning,"" she shuddered and covered
 her face with her hands.


 Brian grabbed her and shook her.


 ""Snap out of it,"" he barked. ""That's no worse than shooting helpless
 men in parachutes. We can't go, yet; we're not finished here.""


 ""Oh, let them shoot us! I can't go through that again!""


 ""You don't have to. Wait here.""


 He climbed back into one of the ships and cut the richness of the fuel
 mixture down till the exhaust was a lambent, shuddering stutter,
 verging on extinction. He dashed to the other ship and repeated the
 maneuver, fussing with the throttle till he had the fuel mixture
 adjusted to critical fineness. The beat of the stuttering exhaust
 seemed to catch up to the other and built to an aching pulsation. In
 a moment the whole mass of air in the cavern hit the frequency with a
 subtle, intangible thunder of vibration.


 Crystal screamed. ""Brian! There's more police cutting in around the
 entrance.""


 Brian clambered out of the ship and glanced at the glowing points
 in the rock where the police were cutting their way through outside
 the line of the exhaust flames. The pulsating thunder in the cavern
 crescendoed to an intolerable pitch. A huge mass of stalactites crashed
 to the floor.


 ""It's time to check out,"" Brian shouted.


 Crystal led the way as they fled down the escape tunnel. The roaring
 crash of falling rock was a continuous, increasing avalanche of sound
 in the cavern behind them.


 They emerged from the tunnel on the face of the mountain, several
 hundred yards to the east of the cavern entrance. The ground shook and
 heaved beneath them.


 ""The whole side of the mountain's sliding,"" Crystal screamed.


 ""Run!"" Brian shoved her and they plunged madly through the thick tangle
 of jungle away from the slide.


 Huge boulders leaped and smashed through the matted bush around them.
 Crystal went down as the ground slipped from under her. Brian grabbed
 her and a tree at the same time. The tree leaned and crashed down the
 slope, the whole jungle muttered and groaned and came to life as it
 joined the roaring rush of the slide. They were tumbled irresistibly
 downward, riding the edge of the slide for terrifying minutes till
 it stilled and left them bruised and shaken in a tangle of torn
 vegetation.


 The remains of two police ships, caught without warning in the rush as
 they attempted to land, stuck up grotesquely out of the foot of the
 slide. The dust was settling away. A flock of brilliant blue, gliding
 lizards barking in raucous terror, fled down the valley. Then they were
 gone and the primeval silence settled back into place.


 Brian and Crystal struggled painfully to solid ground. Crystal gazed
 with a feeling of awe at the devastated mountainside.


 ""How did you do it?""


 ""It's a matter of harmonics,"" Brian explained. ""If you hit the right
 vibratory combination, you can shake anything down. But now that we've
 made a mess of the old homestead, what do we do?""


 ""Walk,"" Crystal said laconically. She led the way as they started
 scrambling through the jungle up the mountainside.


 ""Where are we heading for?"" Brian grunted as he struggled along.


 ""The headquarters of the Carlton family. They're the closest people we
 can depend on. They've kept out of the rebellion, but they're on our
 side. They've helped us before.""

Nothing in the world could be happier and
 
mere serene than a man who loves his work—but
 
what happens when it loves him back?
Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve
 has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero
 and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.
 Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the
 appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, ""I don't
 know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've
 sent him.""


 The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would
 betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant
 and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not
 large for a manufacturing plant—it took a scant minute to exhaust its
 sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if
 he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.


 He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about
 the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,
 more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and
 ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.


 There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and
 none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for
 the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.
 They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large
 as they should have been for a plant this size.


 Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out
 what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees
 changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the
 street, and the only other door was at the loading bay—big enough to
 handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any
 stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the
 employees' entrance was on the third side.


 It wasn't.
Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time
 he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,
 set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had
 opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but
 a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: ""Mr.
 Manners?""


 ""What?"" he panted. ""Who—?""


 ""You
are
Mr. Manners?"" the voice asked.


 He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a
 microphone around; but the soft voice said: ""Follow the open doors down
 the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.""


 ""Thanks,"" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open
 for him.


 He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his
 grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening
 before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of
 his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.


 ""Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!""


 Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped
 just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,
 all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an
 interview—and it's not your fault—this whole setup is geared to
 unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.


 He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,
 straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying
 for a position should.


 ""Mr. Lexington?"" he said. ""I'm Peter Manners. The Association—""


 ""Sit down,"" said the man at the desk. ""Let's look you over.""


 He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in
 front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.
 He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.


 The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with
 a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and
 massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed
 paintings—by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with
 flowers!—made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor
 into Hollywood's idea of an office.


 His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted
 for another instant. This was a citadel of a man—great girders of
 frame supporting buttresses of muscle—with a vaulting head and
 drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.


 But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age
 to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the
 complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and
 this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.


 ""What can you do?"" asked Lexington abruptly.
Peter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been
 jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a
 reply that would cost him this job.


 ""Good,"" said Lexington. ""Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you
 have any knowledge of medicine?""


 ""Not enough to matter,"" Peter said, stung by the compliment.


 ""I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean
 things like cell structure, neural communication—the
basics
of how
 we live.""


 ""I'm applying for a job as engineer.""


 ""I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?""


 Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. ""Of course. Isn't everyone?""


 ""Less than you think,"" Lexington said. ""It's the preconceived notions
 they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them
 out of you.""


 ""Thanks,"" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.


 ""How long have you been out of school?""


 ""Only two years. But you knew that from the Association—""


 ""No practical experience to speak of?""


 ""Some,"" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. ""After
 I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with
 an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The
 company—""


 ""Stockpiled you,"" Lexington said.


 Peter blinked. ""Sir?""


 ""Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?""


 ""Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.""


 ""Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?""


 ""Did what come out—""


 ""That guff about receiving training instead of wages!"" said Lexington.
 ""Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them
 with money—cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of
 their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in
 calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,
 aren't you?""


 ""Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,"" Peter
 admitted cautiously, ""and I suppose I could use a refresher course in
 calculus.""


 ""Just as I said—they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an
 engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would
 be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were
 getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of
 these birds that had the shot paid for him?""


 ""I worked my way through,"" said Peter stiffly.


 ""If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to
 get a job with someone else?""


 Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had
 sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd
 seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.


 ""I hadn't thought about it,"" he said. ""I suppose it wouldn't have been
 easy.""


 ""Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their
 procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And
 you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be
 scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do
 something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you
 out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at
 any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a
 degree—but not the price tag. You see that now?""
It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play
 this straight all the way. He nodded.


 ""Why'd you leave?"" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.


 ""I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent
 basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere—""


 ""With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.""


 Peter swallowed. ""I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has
 been, yes.""


 ""They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?
 So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a
 highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?""


 ""Yes, sir.""


 ""And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this
 stockpiling outfit?""


 ""That's right.""


 ""Well,"" said Lexington unexpectedly, ""there
is
a shortage! And the
 stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the
 hell of it is that they can't stop—when one does it, they all have
 to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the
 solution?""


 ""I don't know,"" Peter said.


 Lexington leaned back. ""That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.
 What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?""


 ""You said you wanted an engineer.""


 ""And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left
 school. I have, haven't I?""


 ""All right, you have,"" Peter said angrily.


 ""And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.
 Right?""


 Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. ""That and
 whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.""


 ""Well, am I?"" Lexington demanded.


 Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,
 Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!
 ""No, you're not.""


 ""Then what am I after?""


 ""Suppose you tell me.""


 So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out
 of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible
 tiredness. ""Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to
 be made—the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your
 illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or
 cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility
 or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.
 Those were the important things. The background data I got from the
 Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.
 I think you are. Am I right?""


 ""At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,"" said Peter, ""if
 that answers the question.""


 ""It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?""


 In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows
 at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,
 the lack of employees' entrances.


 ""Very good,"" said Lexington. ""Most people only notice the automatic
 doors. Anything else?""


 ""Yes,"" Peter said. ""You're the only person I've seen in the building.""


 ""I'm the only one there is.""


 Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but
 they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar
 products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or
 water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the
 goods.


 ""Come on,"" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. ""I'll show
 you.""
The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the
 antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to
 the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly
 disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high
 overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance
 of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool
 of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they
 reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck
 loading door he had seen from outside.


 Lexington paused here. ""This is the bay used by the trucks arriving
 with raw materials,"" he said. ""They back up to this door, and a set
 of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door
 exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these
 materials handling machines.""


 Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening
 machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in
 formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.


 They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with
 two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,
 fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a
 relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.


 Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. ""Really,
 these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole
 plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really
 a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about
 the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously
 useful. You'll see a lot of them around.""


 Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one
 of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily
 tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,
 and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away
 to attend to mysterious duties of their own.
Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of
 frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be
 replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to
 a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and
 other materials were stored.


 ""After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any
 shortages or overages, and store the materials here,"" he said, the
 trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. ""When an order is received,
 it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the
 plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary
 materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and
 package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is
 sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is
 sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if
 the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the
 purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take
 you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but
 they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.""
Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,
 each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding
 or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for
 something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were
 everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an
 exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of
 doing it.


 He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same
 aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the
 onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the
 speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press
 that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an
 exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know
 where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to
 go by.


 Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small
 room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. ""Standard
 business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In
 that room,"" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the
 typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the
 keyboard, ""incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In
 this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall
 there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic
 bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.""


 ""Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?""
 asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that
 had engulfed him.


 ""I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in
 every week that—it doesn't want to deal with by itself.""


 The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face
 when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington
 looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face
 sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the
 silence remain unbroken.


 Finally Lexington spoke. ""I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.""


 ""Hard to believe?"" said Peter. ""I almost can't. The trade journals run
 articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe
 twenty years in the future.""


 ""Damn fools!"" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.
 ""They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their
 idiotic notions about specialization.""


 Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.
 Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,
 although it hadn't been strenuous.
He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely
 in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's
 arrival. ""You know what we make, of course.""


 ""Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.""


 ""And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this
 business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got
 through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and
 got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.
 They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,
 determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too
 absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical
 theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I
 tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for
 one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only
 way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.""


 Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he
 spoke. ""I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,
 because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.
 After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I
 suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for
 a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My
 wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,
 was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that
 made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't
 made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time
 to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out—well, I
 remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the
 girl.


 ""For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many
 employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd
 design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up
 myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it
 wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my
 plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more
 business I got, and the more I had to expand.""


 Lexington scowled. ""I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one
 multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from
 ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told
 you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,
 and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical
 knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,
 but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,
 compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,
 of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic
 drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount
 Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the
 work for me.


 ""By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in
 predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry
 in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of
 the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same
 way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into
 electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,
 and once I'd done that, the battle was over.


 ""I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to
 compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to
 do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in
 the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do
 would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving
 me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue
 numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the
 money.""


 ""What happened to your original company?"" Peter asked.
Lexington smiled. ""Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with
 this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one
 started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought
 the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my
 assets, but only one employee—me.


 ""I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it
 wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked
 impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the
 control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was
 a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit
 nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I
 figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that
 they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one
 action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.


 ""Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units
 would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of
 activity that I'd already established.""


 Here Lexington frowned. ""It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there
 and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and
 then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a
 sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it
 was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its
 prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could
 only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early
 TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,
 every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.""


 ""I—I don't understand,"" stammered Peter.


 ""Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I
 pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its
 logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that
 button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't
 going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,
 or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead
 of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.
 Pretty soon the machine got the idea.


 ""I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one
 of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I
 tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me
 at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could
 discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the
 order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time
 convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other
 explanation.


 ""The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I
 copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the
 console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back
 of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the
 keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the
 kicker button for a full five minutes that day.""


 ""This kicker button,"" Peter said tentatively, ""it's like the pleasure
 center in an animal's brain, isn't it?""
When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this
 man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little
 might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.


 ""Exactly!"" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. ""I
 had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give
 me pleasure—because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be
 activated.


 ""Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine
 was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine
 could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had
 to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the
 rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing
 it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do
 almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.""


 At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled
 silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he
 had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.
 Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, ""How
 do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?""


 Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and
 replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, ""Black, please.""


 A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole
 in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface
 rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested
 on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to
 do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it
 stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface.
Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry
 about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the
 office, then snapped, ""Look at those bloody cups!""


 Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and
 ornately covered with gold leaf. ""They look very expensive,"" he said.


 ""Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!"" exploded Lexington.
 ""They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to
 be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of
 time, the gold leaf comes off!""


 Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,
 so he kept silent.
Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then
 he continued with his narrative. ""I suppose it's all my own fault. I
 didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working
 properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.
 I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I
 also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the
 machine couldn't fix for itself.""


 Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took
 a gulp. ""I began to see that the machine could understand the written
 word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.
 It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny
 vocabulary—all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and
 replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed
 some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.


 ""It had chosen a name for itself, for instance—'Lex.' That shook me.
 You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of
 the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it
 was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,
 but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind
 that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the
 machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums
 I threw might be imitated.""


 ""It sounds pretty awkward,"" Peter put in.


 ""You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to
 do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation
 was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered—too late—that
 the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and
 contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on
 some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any
 obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn
 out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against
 stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we
 could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one
 else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,
 and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually
 nothing to do.""


 ""It sounds wonderful, sir,"" said Peter, feeling dazzled.


 ""It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with
 something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button
 a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,
 and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.
 I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had
 ever sent. 'LEX—WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.


 ""The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had
 seen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX
 INDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM
 PLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE
 PLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY

Earth set itself grimly to meet them with

In the last hours the star ahead had grown brighter by many magnitudes,
 and had changed its color from a dazzling blue through white to the
 normal yellow, of a GO sun. That was the Doppler effect as the star's
 radial velocity changed relative to the
Quest III
, as for forty hours
 the ship had decelerated.


 They had seen many such stars come near out of the galaxy's glittering
 backdrop, and had seen them dwindle, turn red and go out as the
Quest
 III
drove on its way once more, lashed by despair toward the speed of
 light, leaving behind the mockery of yet another solitary and lifeless
 luminary unaccompanied by worlds where men might dwell. They had grown
 sated with the sight of wonders—of multiple systems of giant stars, of
 nebulae that sprawled in empty flame across light years.


 But now unwonted excitement possessed the hundred-odd members of the
Quest III's
crew. It was a subdued excitement; men and women, they
 came and stood quietly gazing into the big vision screens that showed
 the oncoming star, and there were wide-eyed children who had been born
 in the ship and had never seen a planet. The grownups talked in low
 voices, in tones of mingled eagerness and apprehension, of what might
 lie at the long journey's end. For the
Quest III
was coming home; the
 sun ahead was
the
Sun, whose rays had warmed their lives' beginning.
Knof Llud, the
Quest III's
captain, came slowly down the narrow
 stair from the observatory, into the big rotunda that was now the main
 recreation room, where most of the people gathered. The great chamber,
 a full cross-section of the vessel, had been at first a fuel hold. At
 the voyage's beginning eighty per cent of the fifteen-hundred-foot
 cylinder had been engines and fuel; but as the immense stores were
 spent and the holds became radioactively safe, the crew had spread
 out from its original cramped quarters. Now the interstellar ship was
 little more than a hollow shell.


 Eyes lifted from the vision screens to interrogate Knof Llud; he met
 them with an impassive countenance, and announced quietly, ""We've
 sighted Earth.""


 A feverish buzz arose; the captain gestured for silence and went on,
 ""It is still only a featureless disk to the telescope. Zost Relyul has
 identified it—no more.""


 But this time the clamor was not to be settled. People pressed round
 the screens, peering into them as if with the naked eye they could
 pick out the atom of reflected light that was Earth, home. They wrung
 each other's hands, kissed, shouted, wept. For the present their fears
 were forgotten and exaltation prevailed.


 Knof Llud smiled wryly. The rest of the little speech he had been about
 to make didn't matter anyway, and it might have spoiled this moment.


 He turned to go, and was halted by the sight of his wife, standing at
 his elbow. His wry smile took on warmth; he asked, ""How do
you
feel,
 Lesra?""


 She drew an uncertain breath and released it in a faint sigh. ""I don't
 know. It's good that Earth's still there."" She was thinking, he judged
 shrewdly, of Knof Jr. and Delza, who save from pictures could not
 remember sunlit skies or grassy fields or woods in summer....


 He said, with a touch of tolerant amusement, ""What did you think might
 have happened to Earth? After all, it's only been nine hundred years.""


 ""That's just it,"" said Lesra shakily. ""Nine hundred years have gone
 by—
there
—and nothing will be the same. It won't be the same world
 we left, the world we knew and fitted in....""


 The captain put an arm round her with comforting pressure. ""Don't
 worry. Things may have changed—but we'll manage."" But his face had
 hardened against registering the gnawing of that same doubtful fear
 within him. He let his arm fall. ""I'd better get up to the bridge.
 There's a new course to be set now—for Earth.""


 He left her and began to climb the stairway again. Someone switched
 off the lights, and a charmed whisper ran through the big room as the
 people saw each other's faces by the pale golden light of Earth's own
 Sun, mirrored and multiplied by the screens. In that light Lesra's eyes
 gleamed with unshed tears.


 Captain Llud found Navigator Gwar Den looking as smug as the cat
 that ate the canary. Gwar Den was finding that the actual observed
 positions of the planets thus far located agreed quite closely with
 his extrapolations from long unused charts of the Solar System. He had
 already set up on the calculator a course that would carry them to
 Earth.


 Llud nodded curt approval, remarking, ""Probably we'll be intercepted
 before we get that far.""


 Den was jolted out of his happy abstraction. ""Uh, Captain,"" he said
 hesitantly. ""What kind of a reception do you suppose we'll get?""


 Llud shook his head slowly. ""Who knows? We don't know whether any
 of the other
Quests
returned successful, or if they returned at
 all. And we don't know what changes have taken place on Earth. It's
 possible—not likely, though—that something has happened to break
 civilization's continuity to the point where our expedition has been
 forgotten altogether.""
He turned away grim-lipped and left the bridge. From his private
 office-cabin, he sent a message to Chief Astronomer Zost Relyul to
 notify him as soon as Earth's surface features became clear; then he
 sat idle, alone with his thoughts.


 The ship's automatic mechanisms had scant need of tending; Knof Llud
 found himself wishing that he could find some back-breaking task for
 everyone on board, himself included, to fill up the hours that remained.


 There was an extensive and well-chosen film library in the cabin, but
 he couldn't persuade himself to kill time that way. He could go down
 and watch the screens, or to the family apartment where he might find
 Lesra and the children—but somehow he didn't want to do that either.


 He felt empty, drained—like his ship. As the
Quest III's
fuel stores
 and the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the
 strength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost
 empty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old.


 Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight of his nine hundred
 Earth years—though physically he was only forty now, ten years older
 than when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the
 time axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and
 months had passed for the
Quest III
in interstellar flight while
 years and decades had raced by on the home world.


 Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with
 built-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about
 three dozen film spools there—his personal memoirs of the great
 expedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to
 the ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a
 report to whatever powers might be on Earth now—if such powers were
 still interested.


 Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made
 shortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He
 slid it onto the reproducer.


 His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and
 confident than he knew it was now.


 ""One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time
 since leaving Earth.


 ""Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice
 the size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony.


 ""Our hopes were dashed—and I think all of us, even remembering the
 Centaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If
 Procyon had possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after
 an absence of not much over twenty years Earth time.


 ""It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go
 on to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success
 comes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth;
 friends, relatives, all the generation that launched the
Quest
ships
 will be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream,
 humanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever....""


 Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned
 back, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed
 remote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still
 have been ringing in his ears.


 He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another,
 later, one.


 ""One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that
 that system, too, is devoid of planets.


 ""We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably
 true—that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we
 may complete our search without finding even one new Earth.


 ""It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan....
 This may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to
 one world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship
 and its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and
 energy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and
 exhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless
 and transcendent effort—the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids,
 or the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the
 twentieth century.


 ""Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are
 the result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and
 therefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be
 limited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is
 life.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was
 in sight—so we launched the
Quests
. Perhaps our effort will prove as
 futile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to
 reduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport
 very many people to other stars; but Earth could at least go into
 its decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward,
 expanding limitlessly into the Universe....


 ""Hopeless, unless we find planets!""
Knof Llud shook his head sorrowfully and took off the spool. That
 was from the time when he had grown philosophical after the first
 disappointments.


 He frowned thoughtfully, choosing one more spool that was only four
 years old. The recorded voice sounded weary, yet alive with a strange
 longing....


 ""We are in the heart of Pleiades; a hundred stars show brilliant on
 the screens, each star encircled by a misty halo like lights glowing
 through fog, for we are traversing a vast diffuse nebula.


 ""According to plan, the
Quest III
has reached its furthest point from
 Earth. Now we turn back along a curve that will take us past many more
 stars and stellar systems—but hope is small that any of those will
 prove a home for man, as have none of the thousands of stars examined
 already.


 ""But what are a few thousand stars in a galaxy of billions? We have
 only, as it were, visited a handful of the outlying villages of the
 Universe, while the lights of its great cities still blaze far ahead
 along the Milky Way.


 ""On flimsy excuses I have had Zost Relyul make observations of the
 globular cluster Omega Centauri. There are a hundred thousand stars
 there in a volume of space where one finds a few dozen in the Sun's
 neighborhood; there if anywhere must circle the planets we seek! But
 Omega Centauri is twenty thousand light years away....


 ""Even so—by expending its remaining fuel freely, the
Quest III
could
 achieve a velocity that would take us there without dying of senility
 of aging too greatly. It would be a one-way journey—even if enough
 fuel remained, there would be little point in returning to Earth after
 more than forty thousand years. By then our civilization certainly, and
 perhaps the human race itself, would have perished from memory.


 ""That was why the planners limited our voyage, and those of the other
Quests
, to less than a thousand years Earth time. Even now, according
 to the sociodynamic predictions made then, our civilization—if the
 other expeditions failed also—will have reached a dangerously unstable
 phase, and before we can get back it may have collapsed completely from
 overpopulation.


 ""Why go back, then with the news of our failure? Why not forget about
 Earth and go on to Omega Centauri? What use is quixotic loyalty to a
 decree five thousand years old, whose makers are dead and which may be
 forgotten back there?


 ""Would the crew be willing? I don't know—some of them still show signs
 of homesickness, though they know with their minds that everything that
 was once 'home' has probably been swept away....


 ""It doesn't matter. Today I gave orders to swing the ship.""


 Savagely Knof Llud stabbed the button that shut off the speaker. Then
 he sat for a time with head resting in his hands, staring into nothing.


 The memory of that fierce impulse to go on still had power to shake
 him. A couple of lines of poetry came into his head, as he read them
 once in translation from the ancient English....
... for my purpose holds
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
Of all the western stars, until I die.
Llud sighed. He still couldn't say just why he had given the order to
 turn back. The stars had claimed his heart—but he was still a part of
 Earth, and not even nine hundred years of space and time had been able
 to alter that.


 He wondered if there would still be a quiet stream and a green
 shady place beside it where a death-weary man, relieved at last of
 responsibility, could rest and dream no more.... Those things went
 on, if men didn't change them. And a pine forest where he and young
 Knof could go camping, and lie on their backs at night and gaze at the
 glittering constellations, far away, out of reach.... He wasn't sure he
 would want to do that, though.


 Suddenly a faint cushioned jar went through the great ship; it seemed
 to falter one moment in flight.
The captain was on his feet instantly, but then his movements became
 unhurried. Whatever it had been was past, and he had a good idea
 what it had been—a meteoroid, nothing unusual in the vicinity of
 the Sun, though in interstellar space and around planetless stars
 such collisions were rare to the vanishing point. No harm could have
 been done. The
Quest III's
collision armor was nonmaterial and for
 practical purposes invulnerable.


 Just as he took his finger off the button that opened the door, the
 intercommunication phone shrilled imperatively. Knof Llud wheeled,
 frowning—surely a meteoroid impact wasn't that serious. Coincidence,
 maybe—it might be Zost Relyul calling as instructed.


 He reached the phone at the moment when another, heavier jolt shook
 the vessel. Llud snatched up the receiver with the speed of a scalded
 cat.


 ""Captain?"" It was Gwar Den's voice, stammering a little. ""Captain,
 we're being attacked!""


 ""Sound the alarm. Emergency stations."" He had said it automatically,
 then felt a curious detached relief at the knowledge that after all
 these years he could still respond quickly and smoothly to a crisis.
 There was a moment's silence, and he heard the alarm start—three
 short buzzes and repeat, ringing through all the great length of the
 interstellar ship. Knowing that Gwar Den was still there, he said,
 ""Now—attacked by what?""


 ""Ships,"" said Gwar Den helplessly. ""Five of them so far. No, there's a
 sixth now."" Repeated blows quivered the
Quest III's
framework. The
 navigator said, obviously striving for calm, ""They're light craft, not
 fifty feet long, but they move fast. The detectors hardly had time to
 show them before they opened up. Can't get a telescope beam on them
 long enough to tell much.""


 ""If they're that small,"" said Knof Llud deliberately, ""they can't carry
 anything heavy enough to hurt us. Hold to course. I'll be right up.""


 In the open doorway he almost fell over his son. Young Knof's eyes were
 big; he had heard his father's words.


 ""Something's happened,"" he judged with deadly twelve-year-old
 seriousness and, without wasting time on questions, ""Can I go with you,
 huh, Dad?""


 Llud hesitated, said, ""All right. Come along and keep out of the way.""
 He headed for the bridge with strides that the boy could not match.


 There were people running in the corridors, heading for their posts.
 Their faces were set, scared, uncomprehending. The
Quest III
shuddered, again and again, under blows that must have had millions
 of horsepower behind them; but it plunged on toward Earth, its mighty
 engines still steadily braking its interstellar velocity.


 To a man, the ship's responsible officers were already on the bridge,
 most of them breathless. To a man they looked appeal at Captain Knof
 Llud.


 ""Well?"" he snapped. ""What are they doing?""


 Gwar Den spoke. ""There are thirteen of them out there now, sir, and
 they're all banging away at us.""


 The captain stared into the black star-strewn depths of a vision screen
 where occasional blue points of light winked ominously, never twice
 from the same position.


 Knof Jr. flattened himself against the metal wall and watched silently.
 His young face was less anxious than his elders'; he had confidence in
 his father.


 ""If they had anything heavier,"" surmised the captain, ""they'd have
 unlimbered it by now. They're out to get us. But at this rate, they
 can't touch us as long as our power lasts—or until they bring up some
 bigger stuff.""
The mild shocks went on—whether from projectiles or energy-charges,
 would be hard to find out and it didn't matter; whatever was hitting
 the
Quest III's
shell was doing it at velocities where the
 distinction between matter and radiation practically ceases to exist.


 But that shell was tough. It was an extension of the gravitic drive
 field which transmitted the engines' power equally to every atom of
 the ship; forces impinging on the outside of the field were similarly
 transmitted and rendered harmless. The effect was as if the vessel and
 all space inside its field were a single perfectly elastic body. A
 meteoroid, for example, on striking it rebounded—usually vaporized by
 the impact—and the ship, in obedience to the law of equal and opposite
 forces, rebounded too, but since its mass was so much greater, its
 deflection was negligible.


 The people in the
Quest III
would have felt nothing at all of
 the vicious onslaught being hurled against them, save that their
 inertialess drive, at its normal thrust of two hundred gravities,
 was intentionally operated at one half of one per cent efficiency to
 provide the illusion of Earthly gravitation.


 One of the officers said shakily, ""It's as if they've been lying in
 wait for us. But why on Earth—""


 ""That,"" said the captain grimly, ""is what we have to find out. Why—on
 Earth. At least, I suspect the answer's there.""


 The
Quest III
bored steadily on through space, decelerating. Even if
 one were no fatalist, there seemed no reason to stop decelerating or
 change course. There was nowhere else to go and too little fuel left
 if there had been; come what might, this was journey's end—perhaps
 in a more violent and final way than had been anticipated. All around
 wheeled the pigmy enemies, circling, maneuvering, and attacking,
 always attacking, with the senseless fury of maddened hornets. The
 interstellar ship bore no offensive weapons—but suddenly on one of the
 vision screens a speck of light flared into nova-brilliance, dazzling
 the watchers for the brief moment in which its very atoms were torn
 apart.


 Knof Jr. whooped ecstatically and then subsided warily, but no one was
 paying attention to him. The men on the
Quest III's
bridge looked
 questions at each other, as the thought of help from outside flashed
 into many minds at once. But Captain Llud said soberly, ""It must have
 caught one of their own shots, reflected. Maybe its own, if it scored
 too direct a hit.""


 He studied the data so far gathered. A few blurred pictures had been
 got, which showed cylindrical space ships much like the
Quest III
,
 except that they were rocket-propelled and of far lesser size. Their
 size was hard to ascertain, because you needed to know their distance
 and speed—but detector-beam echoes gave the distance, and likewise, by
 the Doppler method, the velocity of directly receding or approaching
 ships. It was apparent that the enemy vessels were even smaller than
 Gwar Den had at first supposed—not large enough to hold even one man.
 Tiny, deadly hornets with a colossal sting.


 ""Robot craft, no doubt,"" said Knof Llud, but a chill ran down his spine
 as it occurred to him that perhaps the attackers weren't of human
 origin. They had seen no recognizable life in the part of the galaxy
 they had explored, but one of the other
Quests
might have encountered
 and been traced home by some unhuman race that was greedy and able to
 conquer.
It became evident, too, that the bombardment was being kept up by a
 constant arrival of fresh attackers, while others raced away into
 space, presumably returning to base to replenish their ammunition. That
 argued a planned and prepared interception with virulent hatred behind
 it.


 Elsuz Llug, the gravitic engineer, calculated dismally, ""At the rate
 we're having to shed energy, the fuel will be gone in six or eight
 hours.""


 ""We'll have reached Earth before then,"" Gwar Den said hopefully.


 ""If they don't bring out the heavy artillery first.""


 ""We're under the psychological disadvantage,"" said the captain, ""of not
 knowing why we're being attacked.""


 Knof Jr. burst out, spluttering slightly with the violence of a
 thought too important to suppress, ""But we're under a ps-psychological
 advantage, too!""


 His father raised an eyebrow. ""What's that? I don't seem to have
 noticed it.""


 ""They're mad and we aren't, yet,"" said the boy. Then, seeing that he
 hadn't made himself clear, ""In a fight, if a guy gets mad he starts
 swinging wild and then you nail him.""


 Smiles splintered the ice of tension. Captain Llud said, ""Maybe you've
 got something there. They seem to be mad, all right. But we're not in
 a position to throw any punches."" He turned back to the others. ""As I
 was going to say—I think we'd better try to parley with the enemy. At
 least we may find out who he is and why he's determined to smash us.""


 And now instead of tight-beam detectors the ship was broadcasting on an
 audio carrier wave that shifted through a wide range of frequencies,
 repeating on each the same brief recorded message:


 ""Who are you? What do you want? We are the interstellar expedition
Quest III
...."" And so on, identifying themselves and protesting that
 they were unarmed and peaceful, that there must be some mistake, and
 querying again, ""Who are
you
?""


 There was no answer. The ship drove on, its fuel trickling away under
 multiplied demands. Those outside were squandering vastly greater
 amounts of energy in the effort to batter down its defenses, but
 converting that energy into harmless gravitic impulses was costing the
Quest III
too. Once more Knof Llud had the insidious sense of his own
 nerves and muscles and will weakening along with the power-sinews of
 his ship.


 Zost Relyul approached him apologetically. ""If you have time,
 Captain—I've got some data on Earth now.""


 Eagerly Llud took the sheaf of photographs made with the telescope. But
 they told him nothing; only the continental outlines were clear, and
 those were as they had been nine hundred years ago.... He looked up
 inquiringly at Zost Relyul.


 ""There are some strange features,"" said the astronomer carefully.
 ""First of all—there are no lights on the night side. And on the
 daylight face, our highest magnification should already reveal traces
 of cities, canals, and the like—but it does not.


 ""The prevailing color of the land masses, you see, is the normal
 green vegetation. But the diffraction spectrum is queer. It indicates
 reflecting surfaces less than one-tenth millimeter wide—so the
 vegetation there can't be trees or grass, but must be more like a fine
 moss or even a coarse mold.""


 ""Is that all?"" demanded Llud.


 ""Isn't it enough?"" said Zost Relyul blankly. ""Well—we tried
 photography by invisible light, of course. The infra-red shows nothing
 and likewise the ultraviolet up to the point where the atmosphere is
 opaque to it.""


 The captain sighed wearily. ""Good work,"" he said. ""Keep it up; perhaps
 you can answer some of these riddles before—""


 ""
We know who you are
,"" interrupted a harshly crackling voice with a
 strange accent, ""
and pleading will do you no good.
""
Knof Llud whirled to the radio apparatus, his weariness dropping from
 him once more. He snapped, ""But who are you?"" and the words blended
 absurdly with the same words in his own voice on the still repeating
 tape.


 He snapped off the record; as he did so the speaker, still crackling
 with space static, said, ""It may interest you to know that you are the
 last. The two other interstellar expeditions that went out have already
 returned and been destroyed, as you will soon be—the sooner, if you
 continue toward Earth.""


 Knof Llud's mind was clicking again. The voice—which must be coming
 from Earth, relayed by one of the midget ships—was not very smart; it
 had already involuntarily told him a couple of things—that it was not
 as sure of itself as it sounded he deduced from the fact it had deigned
 to speak at all, and from its last remark he gathered that the
Quest
 III's
ponderous and unswerving progress toward Earth had somehow
 frightened it. So it was trying to frighten them.


 He shoved those facts back for future use. Just now he had to know
 something, so vitally that he asked it as a bald question, ""
Are you
 human?
""


 The voice chuckled sourly. ""We are human,"" it answered, ""but you are
 not.""


 The captain was momentarily silent, groping for an adequate reply.
 Behind him somebody made a choked noise, the only sound in the stunned
 hush, and the ship jarred slightly as a thunderbolt slammed vengefully
 into its field.


 ""Suppose we settle this argument about humanity,"" said Knof Llud
 woodenly. He named a vision frequency.


 ""Very well."" The tone was like a shrug. The voice went on in its
 language that was quite intelligible, but alien-sounding with the
 changes that nine hundred years had wrought. ""Perhaps, if you realize
 your position, you will follow the intelligent example of the
Quest
 I's
commander.""


 Knof Llud stiffened. The
Quest I
, launched toward Arcturus and the
 star cloud called Berenice's Hair, had been after the
Quest III
the
 most hopeful of the expeditions—and its captain had been a good friend
 of Llud's, nine hundred years ago.... He growled, ""What happened to
 him?""


 ""He fought off our interceptors, which are around you now, for some
 time,"" said the voice lightly. ""When he saw that it was hopeless, he
 preferred suicide to defeat, and took his ship into the Sun."" A short
 pause. ""The vision connection is ready.""


 Knof Llud switched on the screen at the named wavelength, and a
 picture formed there. The face and figure that appeared were ugly,
 but undeniably a man's. His features and his light-brown skin showed
 the same racial characteristics possessed by those aboard the
Quest
 III
, but he had an elusive look of deformity. Most obviously, his head
 seemed too big for his body, and his eyes in turn too big for his head.


 He grinned nastily at Knof Llud. ""Have you any other last wishes?""


 ""Yes,"" said Llud with icy control. ""You haven't answered one question.
 Why do you want to kill us? You can see we're as human as you are.""


 The big-headed man eyed him with a speculative look in his great
 eyes, behind which the captain glimpsed the flickering raw fire of a
 poisonous hatred.


 ""It is enough for you to know that you must die.""

BY JAMES BLISH
Illustrated by van Dongen


 On the day that the Polish freighter
Ludmilla
laid an egg in New
 York harbor, Abner Longmans
 (""One-Shot"") Braun was in the city
 going about his normal business,
 which was making another million
 dollars. As we found out later, almost
 nothing else was normal about
 that particular week end for Braun.
 For one thing, he had brought his
 family with him—a complete departure
 from routine—reflecting the unprecedentedly
 legitimate nature of
 the deals he was trying to make.
 From every point of view it was a
 bad week end for the CIA to mix
 into his affairs, but nobody had explained
 that to the master of the
Ludmilla
.


 I had better add here that we
 knew nothing about this until afterward;
 from the point of view of the
 storyteller, an organization like Civilian
 Intelligence Associates gets to
 all its facts backwards, entering the
 tale at the pay-off, working back to
 the hook, and winding up with a
 sheaf of background facts to feed
 into the computer for Next Time. It's
 rough on the various people who've
 tried to fictionalize what we do—particularly
 for the lazy examples of
 the breed, who come to us expecting
 that their plotting has already been
 done for them—but it's inherent in
 the way we operate, and there it is.


 Certainly nobody at CIA so much
 as thought of Braun when the news
 first came through. Harry Anderton,
 the Harbor Defense chief, called us
 at 0830 Friday to take on the job of
 identifying the egg; this was when
 our records show us officially entering
 the affair, but, of course, Anderton
 had been keeping the wires to
 Washington steaming for an hour before
 that, getting authorization to
 spend some of his money on us (our
 clearance status was then and is now
 C&amp;R—clean and routine).


 I was in the central office when
 the call came through, and had some
 difficulty in making out precisely
 what Anderton wanted of us. ""Slow
 down, Colonel Anderton, please,"" I
 begged him. ""Two or three seconds
 won't make that much difference.
 How did you find out about this egg
 in the first place?""


 ""The automatic compartment bulkheads
 on the
Ludmilla
were defective,""
 he said. ""It seems that this
 egg was buried among a lot of other
 crates in the dump-cell of the
 hold—""


 ""What's a dump cell?""


 ""It's a sea lock for getting rid of
 dangerous cargo. The bottom of it
 opens right to Davy Jones. Standard
 fitting for ships carrying explosives,
 radioactives, anything that might act
 up unexpectedly.""


 ""All right,"" I said. ""Go ahead.""


 ""Well, there was a timer on the
 dump-cell floor, set to drop the egg
 when the ship came up the river.
 That worked fine, but the automatic
 bulkheads that are supposed to keep
 the rest of the ship from being flooded
 while the cell's open, didn't. At
 least they didn't do a thorough job.
 The
Ludmilla
began to list and the
 captain yelled for help. When the
 Harbor Patrol found the dump-cell
 open, they called us in.""


 ""I see."" I thought about it a moment.
 ""In other words, you don't
 know whether the
Ludmilla
really
 laid an egg or not.""


 ""That's what I keep trying to explain
 to you, Dr. Harris. We don't
 know what she dropped and we
 haven't any way of finding out. It
 could be a bomb—it could be anything.
 We're sweating everybody on
 board the ship now, but it's my guess
 that none of them know anything;
 the whole procedure was designed to
 be automatic.""


 ""All right, we'll take it,"" I said.
 ""You've got divers down?""


 ""Sure, but—""


 ""We'll worry about the buts from
 here on. Get us a direct line from
 your barge to the big board here so
 we can direct the work. Better get
 on over here yourself.""


 ""Right."" He sounded relieved.
 Official people have a lot of confidence
 in CIA; too much, in my estimation.
 Some day the job will come
 along that we can't handle, and then
 Washington will be kicking itself—or,
 more likely, some scapegoat—for
 having failed to develop a comparable
 government department.


 Not that there was much prospect
 of Washington's doing that. Official
 thinking had been running in the
 other direction for years. The precedent
 was the Associated Universities
 organization which ran Brookhaven;
 CIA had been started the same way,
 by a loose corporation of universities
 and industries all of which had
 wanted to own an ULTIMAC and
 no one of which had had the money
 to buy one for itself. The Eisenhower
 administration, with its emphasis
 on private enterprise and concomitant
 reluctance to sink federal
 funds into projects of such size, had
 turned the two examples into a nice
 fat trend, which ULTIMAC herself
 said wasn't going to be reversed
 within the practicable lifetime of
 CIA.
I buzzed for two staffers, and in
 five minutes got Clark Cheyney and
 Joan Hadamard, CIA's business manager
 and social science division chief
 respectively. The titles were almost
 solely for the benefit of the T/O—that
 is, Clark and Joan do serve in
 those capacities, but said service takes
 about two per cent of their capacities
 and their time. I shot them a couple
 of sentences of explanation, trusting
 them to pick up whatever else they
 needed from the tape, and checked
 the line to the divers' barge.


 It was already open; Anderton had
 gone to work quickly and with decision
 once he was sure we were taking
 on the major question. The television
 screen lit, but nothing showed
 on it but murky light, striped with
 streamers of darkness slowly rising
 and falling. The audio went
cloonck
...
oing
,
oing
...
bonk
...
oing
... Underwater noises, shapeless
 and characterless.


 ""Hello, out there in the harbor.
 This is CIA, Harris calling. Come in,
 please.""


 ""Monig here,"" the audio said.
Boink
...
oing
,
oing
...


 ""Got anything yet?""


 ""Not a thing, Dr. Harris,"" Monig
 said. ""You can't see three inches in
 front of your face down here—it's
 too silty. We've bumped into a couple
 of crates, but so far, no egg.""


 ""Keep trying.""


 Cheyney, looking even more like
 a bulldog than usual, was setting his
 stopwatch by one of the eight clocks
 on ULTIMAC's face. ""Want me to
 take the divers?"" he said.


 ""No, Clark, not yet. I'd rather
 have Joan do it for the moment."" I
 passed the mike to her. ""You'd better
 run a probability series first.""


 ""Check."" He began feeding tape
 into the integrator's mouth. ""What's
 your angle, Peter?""


 ""The ship. I want to see how heavily
 shielded that dump-cell is.""


 ""It isn't shielded at all,"" Anderton's
 voice said behind me. I hadn't
 heard him come in. ""But that doesn't
 prove anything. The egg might have
 carried sufficient shielding in itself.
 Or maybe the Commies didn't care
 whether the crew was exposed or not.
 Or maybe there isn't any egg.""


 ""All that's possible,"" I admitted.
 ""But I want to see it, anyhow.""


 ""Have you taken blood tests?""
 Joan asked Anderton.


 ""Yes.""


 ""Get the reports through to me,
 then. I want white-cell counts, differentials,
 platelet counts, hematocrit
 and sed rates on every man.""


 Anderton picked up the phone and
 I took a firm hold on the doorknob.


 ""Hey,"" Anderton said, putting the
 phone down again. ""Are you going
 to duck out just like that? Remember,
 Dr. Harris, we've got to evacuate the
 city first of all! No matter whether
 it's a real egg or not—we can't take
 the chance on it's
not
being an egg!""


 ""Don't move a man until you get
 a go-ahead from CIA,"" I said. ""For
 all we know now, evacuating the city
 may be just what the enemy wants us
 to do—so they can grab it unharmed.
 Or they may want to start a panic
 for some other reason, any one of
 fifty possible reasons.""


 ""You can't take such a gamble,""
 he said grimly. ""There are eight and
 a half million lives riding on it. I
 can't let you do it.""


 ""You passed your authority to us
 when you hired us,"" I pointed out.
 ""If you want to evacuate without our
 O.K., you'll have to fire us first. It'll
 take another hour to get that cleared
 from Washington—so you might as
 well give us the hour.""


 He stared at me for a moment, his
 lips thinned. Then he picked up the
 phone again to order Joan's blood
 count, and I got out the door, fast.
A reasonable man would have said
 that I found nothing useful on the
Ludmilla
, except negative information.
 But the fact is that anything I
 found would have been a surprise to
 me; I went down looking for surprises.
 I found nothing but a faint
 trail to Abner Longmans Braun, most
 of which was fifteen years cold.


 There'd been a time when I'd
 known Braun, briefly and to no
 profit to either of us. As an undergraduate
 majoring in social sciences,
 I'd taken on a term paper on the old
 International Longshoreman's Association,
 a racket-ridden union now
 formally extinct—although anyone
 who knew the signs could still pick
 up some traces on the docks. In those
 days, Braun had been the business
 manager of an insurance firm, the
 sole visible function of which had
 been to write policies for the ILA
 and its individual dock-wallopers.
 For some reason, he had been amused
 by the brash youngster who'd barged
 in on him and demanded the lowdown,
 and had shown me considerable
 lengths of ropes not normally
 in view of the public—nothing incriminating,
 but enough to give me
 a better insight into how the union
 operated than I had had any right to
 expect—or even suspect.


 Hence I was surprised to hear
 somebody on the docks remark that
 Braun was in the city over the week
 end. It would never have occurred
 to me that he still interested himself
 in the waterfront, for he'd gone respectable
 with a vengeance. He was
 still a professional gambler, and according
 to what he had told the
 Congressional Investigating Committee
 last year, took in thirty to fifty
 thousand dollars a year at it, but his
 gambles were no longer concentrated
 on horses, the numbers, or shady insurance
 deals. Nowadays what he did
 was called investment—mostly in real
 estate; realtors knew him well as the
 man who had
almost
bought the Empire
 State Building. (The
almost
in
 the equation stands for the moment
 when the shoestring broke.)


 Joan had been following his career,
 too, not because she had ever met
 him, but because for her he was a
 type study in the evolution of what
 she called ""the extra-legal ego.""
 ""With personalities like that, respectability
 is a disease,"" she told me.
 ""There's always an almost-open conflict
 between the desire to be powerful
 and the desire to be accepted;
 your ordinary criminal is a moral imbecile,
 but people like Braun are
 damned with a conscience, and sooner
 or later they crack trying to appease
 it.""


 ""I'd sooner try to crack a Timkin
 bearing,"" I said. ""Braun's ten-point
 steel all the way through.""


 ""Don't you believe it. The symptoms
 are showing all over him. Now
 he's backing Broadway plays, sponsoring
 beginning actresses, joining
 playwrights' groups—he's the only
 member of Buskin and Brush who's
 never written a play, acted in one, or
 so much as pulled the rope to raise
 the curtain.""


 ""That's investment,"" I said.
 ""That's his business.""


 ""Peter, you're only looking at the
 surface. His real investments almost
 never fail. But the plays he backs
always
do. They have to; he's sinking
 money in them to appease his conscience,
 and if they were to succeed it
 would double his guilt instead of
 salving it. It's the same way with the
 young actresses. He's not sexually
 interested in them—his type never is,
 because living a rigidly orthodox
 family life is part of the effort towards
 respectability. He's backing
 them to 'pay his debt to society'—in
 other words, they're talismans to
 keep him out of jail.""


 ""It doesn't seem like a very satisfactory
 substitute.""


 ""Of course it isn't,"" Joan had said.
 ""The next thing he'll do is go in for
 direct public service—giving money
 to hospitals or something like that.
 You watch.""


 She had been right; within the
 year, Braun had announced the
 founding of an association for clearing
 the Detroit slum area where he
 had been born—the plainest kind of
 symbolic suicide:
Let's not have any
 more Abner Longmans Brauns born
 down here
. It depressed me to see it
 happen, for next on Joan's agenda
 for Braun was an entry into politics
 as a fighting liberal—a New Dealer
 twenty years too late. Since I'm mildly
 liberal myself when I'm off duty,
 I hated to think what Braun's career
 might tell me about my own motives,
 if I'd let it.
All of which had nothing to do
 with why I was prowling around the
Ludmilla
—or did it? I kept remembering
 Anderton's challenge: ""You
 can't take such a gamble. There are
 eight and a half million lives riding
 on it—"" That put it up into Braun's
 normal operating area, all right. The
 connection was still hazy, but on the
 grounds that any link might be useful,
 I phoned him.


 He remembered me instantly; like
 most uneducated, power-driven men,
 he had a memory as good as any machine's.


 ""You never did send me that paper
 you was going to write,"" he said. His
 voice seemed absolutely unchanged,
 although he was in his seventies now.
 ""You promised you would.""


 ""Kids don't keep their promises
 as well as they should,"" I said. ""But
 I've still got copies and I'll see to it
 that you get one, this time. Right
 now I need another favor—something
 right up your alley.""


 ""CIA business?""


 ""Yes. I didn't know you knew I
 was with CIA.""


 Braun chuckled. ""I still know a
 thing or two,"" he said. ""What's the
 angle?""


 ""That I can't tell you over the
 phone. But it's the biggest gamble
 there ever was, and I think we need
 an expert. Can you come down to
 CIA's central headquarters right
 away?""


 ""Yeah, if it's that big. If it ain't,
 I got lots of business here, Andy.
 And I ain't going to be in town long.
 You're sure it's top stuff?""


 ""My word on it.""


 He was silent a moment. Then he
 said, ""Andy, send me your paper.""


 ""The paper? Sure, but—"" Then I
 got it. I'd given him my word.
 ""You'll get it,"" I said. ""Thanks, Mr.
 Braun.""


 I called headquarters and sent a
 messenger to my apartment to look
 for one of those long-dusty blue folders
 with the legal-length sheets inside
 them, with orders to scorch it over
 to Braun without stopping to breathe
 more than once. Then I went back
 myself.


 The atmosphere had changed. Anderton
 was sitting by the big desk,
 clenching his fists and sweating; his
 whole posture telegraphed his controlled
 helplessness. Cheyney was
 bent over a seismograph, echo-sounding
 for the egg through the river
 bottom. If that even had a prayer of
 working, I knew, he'd have had the
 trains of the Hudson &amp; Manhattan
 stopped; their rumbling course
 through their tubes would have
 blanked out any possible echo-pip
 from the egg.


 ""Wild goose chase?"" Joan said,
 scanning my face.


 ""Not quite. I've got something, if
 I can just figure out what it is. Remember
 One-Shot Braun?""


 ""Yes. What's he got to do with
 it?""


 ""Nothing,"" I said. ""But I want
 to bring him in. I don't think we'll
 lick this project before deadline without
 him.""


 ""What good is a professional
 gambler on a job like this? He'll just
 get in the way.""


 I looked toward the television
 screen, which now showed an
 amorphous black mass, jutting up
 from a foundation of even deeper
 black. ""Is that operation getting you
 anywhere?""


 ""Nothing's gotten us anywhere,""
 Anderton interjected harshly. ""We
 don't even know if that's the egg—the
 whole area is littered with crates.
 Harris, you've got to let me get that
 alert out!""


 ""Clark, how's the time going?""


 Cheyney consulted the stopwatch.
 ""Deadline in twenty-nine minutes,""
 he said.


 ""All right, let's use those minutes.
 I'm beginning to see this thing
 a little clearer. Joan, what we've got
 here is a one-shot gamble; right?""


 ""In effect,"" she said cautiously.


 ""And it's my guess that we're
 never going to get the answer by
 diving for it—not in time, anyhow.
 Remember when the Navy lost a
 barge-load of shells in the harbor,
 back in '52? They scrabbled for them
 for a year and never pulled up a one;
 they finally had to warn the public
 that if it found anything funny-looking
 along the shore it shouldn't bang
 said object, or shake it either. We're
 better equipped than the Navy was
 then—but we're working against a
 deadline.""


 ""If you'd admitted that earlier,""
 Anderton said hoarsely, ""we'd have
 half a million people out of the city
 by now. Maybe even a million.""


 ""We haven't given up yet, colonel.
 The point is this, Joan: what
 we need is an inspired guess. Get
 anything from the prob series, Clark?
 I thought not. On a one-shot gamble
 of this kind, the 'laws' of chance are
 no good at all. For that matter, the
 so-called ESP experiments showed us
 long ago that even the way we construct
 random tables is full of holes—and
 that a man with a feeling for
 the essence of a gamble can make a
 monkey out of chance almost at will.


 ""And if there ever was such a
 man, Braun is it. That's why I asked
 him to come down here. I want him
 to look at that lump on the screen
 and—play a hunch.""


 ""You're out of your mind,"" Anderton
 said.
A decorous knock spared me the
 trouble of having to deny, affirm or
 ignore the judgment. It was Braun;
 the messenger had been fast, and
 the gambler hadn't bothered to read
 what a college student had thought
 of him fifteen years ago. He came
 forward and held out his hand, while
 the others looked him over frankly.


 He was impressive, all right. It
 would have been hard for a stranger
 to believe that he was aiming at respectability;
 to the eye, he was already
 there. He was tall and spare,
 and walked perfectly erect, not without
 spring despite his age. His clothing
 was as far from that of a
 gambler as you could have taken it
 by design: a black double-breasted
 suit with a thin vertical stripe, a gray
 silk tie with a pearl stickpin just
 barely large enough to be visible at
 all, a black Homburg; all perfectly
 fitted, all worn with proper casualness—one
 might almost say a formal
 casualness. It was only when he
 opened his mouth that One-Shot
 Braun was in the suit with him.


 ""I come over as soon as your runner
 got to me,"" he said. ""What's the
 pitch, Andy?""


 ""Mr. Braun, this is Joan Hadamard,
 Clark Cheyney, Colonel Anderton.
 I'll be quick because we need
 speed now. A Polish ship has dropped
 something out in the harbor.
 We don't know what it is. It may be
 a hell-bomb, or it may be just somebody's
 old laundry. Obviously we've
 got to find out which—and we want
 you to tell us.""


 Braun's aristocratic eyebrows went
 up. ""Me? Hell, Andy, I don't know
 nothing about things like that. I'm
 surprised with you. I thought CIA
 had all the brains it needed—ain't
 you got machines to tell you answers
 like that?""


 I pointed silently to Joan, who had
 gone back to work the moment the
 introductions were over. She was still
 on the mike to the divers. She was
 saying: ""What does it look like?""


 ""It's just a lump of something,
 Dr. Hadamard. Can't even tell its
 shape—it's buried too deeply in the
 mud.""
Cloonk
...
Oing
,
oing
...


 ""Try the Geiger.""


 ""We did. Nothing but background.""


 ""Scintillation counter?""


 ""Nothing, Dr. Hadamard. Could
 be it's shielded.""


 ""Let us do the guessing, Monig.
 All right, maybe it's got a clockwork
 fuse that didn't break with the impact.
 Or a gyroscopic fuse. Stick a
 stethoscope on it and see if you pick
 up a ticking or anything that sounds
 like a motor running.""
There was a lag and I turned back
 to Braun. ""As you can see, we're
 stymied. This is a long shot, Mr.
 Braun. One throw of the dice—one
 show-down hand. We've got to have
 an expert call it for us—somebody
 with a record of hits on long shots.
 That's why I called you.""


 ""It's no good,"" he said. He took
 off the Homburg, took his handkerchief
 from his breast pocket, and
 wiped the hatband. ""I can't do it.""


 ""Why not?""


 ""It ain't my
kind
of thing,"" he
 said. ""Look, I never in my life run
 odds on anything that made any difference.
 But this makes a difference.
 If I guess wrong—""


 ""Then we're all dead ducks. But
 why should you guess wrong? Your
 hunches have been working for sixty
 years now.""


 Braun wiped his face. ""No. You
 don't get it. I wish you'd listen to
 me. Look, my wife and my kids are
 in the city. It ain't only my life, it's
 theirs, too. That's what I care about.
 That's why it's no good. On things
 that matter to me,
my hunches don't
 work
.""


 I was stunned, and so, I could see,
 were Joan and Cheyney. I suppose I
 should have guessed it, but it had
 never occurred to me.


 ""Ten minutes,"" Cheyney said.


 I looked up at Braun. He was
 frightened, and again I was surprised
 without having any right to
 be. I tried to keep at least my voice
 calm.


 ""Please try it anyhow, Mr. Braun—as
 a favor. It's already too late to
 do it any other way. And if you guess
 wrong, the outcome won't be any
 worse than if you don't try at all.""


 ""My kids,"" he whispered. I don't
 think he knew that he was speaking
 aloud. I waited.


 Then his eyes seemed to come back
 to the present. ""All right,"" he said.
 ""I told you the truth, Andy. Remember
 that. So—is it a bomb or ain't it?
 That's what's up for grabs, right?""


 I nodded. He closed his eyes. An
 unexpected stab of pure fright went
 down my back. Without the eyes,
 Braun's face was a death mask.


 The water sounds and the irregular
 ticking of a Geiger counter
 seemed to spring out from the audio
 speaker, four times as loud as before.
 I could even hear the pen of
 the seismograph scribbling away, until
 I looked at the instrument and
 saw that Clark had stopped it, probably
 long ago.


 Droplets of sweat began to form
 along Braun's forehead and his upper
 lip. The handkerchief remained
 crushed in his hand.


 Anderton said, ""Of all the fool—""


 ""Hush!"" Joan said quietly.
Slowly, Braun opened his eyes.
 ""All right,"" he said. ""You guys
 wanted it this way.
I say it's a bomb.
""
 He stared at us for a moment more—and
 then, all at once, the Timkin
 bearing burst. Words poured out of
 it. ""Now you guys do something, do
 your job like I did mine—get my
 wife and kids out of there—empty
 the city—do something,
do something
!""


 Anderton was already grabbing
 for the phone. ""You're right, Mr.
 Braun. If it isn't already too late—""


 Cheyney shot out a hand and
 caught Anderton's telephone arm by
 the wrist. ""Wait a minute,"" he said.


 ""What d'you mean, 'wait a minute'?
 Haven't you already shot
 enough time?""


 Cheyney did not let go; instead,
 he looked inquiringly at Joan and
 said, ""One minute, Joan. You might
 as well go ahead.""


 She nodded and spoke into the
 mike. ""Monig, unscrew the cap.""


 ""Unscrew the cap?"" the audio
 squawked. ""But Dr. Hadamard, if
 that sets it off—""


 ""It won't go off. That's the one
 thing you can be sure it won't do.""


 ""What is this?"" Anderton demanded.
 ""And what's this deadline
 stuff, anyhow?""


 ""The cap's off,"" Monig reported.
 ""We're getting plenty of radiation
 now. Just a minute— Yeah. Dr.
 Hadamard, it's a bomb, all right.
 But it hasn't got a fuse. Now how
 could they have made a fool mistake
 like that?""


 ""In other words, it's a dud,"" Joan
 said.


 ""That's right, a dud.""


 Now, at last, Braun wiped his face,
 which was quite gray. ""I told you
 the truth,"" he said grimly. ""My
 hunches don't work on stuff like
 this.""


 ""But they do,"" I said. ""I'm sorry
 we put you through the wringer—and
 you too, colonel—but we couldn't
 let an opportunity like this slip.
 It was too good a chance for us to
 test how our facilities would stand
 up in a real bomb-drop.""


 ""A real drop?"" Anderton said.
 ""Are you trying to say that CIA
 staged this? You ought to be shot,
 the whole pack of you!""


 ""No, not exactly,"" I said. ""The
 enemy's responsible for the drop, all
 right. We got word last month from
 our man in Gdynia that they were
 going to do it, and that the bomb
 would be on board the
Ludmilla
. As
 I say, it was too good an opportunity
 to miss. We wanted to find out just
 how long it would take us to figure
 out the nature of the bomb—which
 we didn't know in detail—after it
 was dropped here. So we had our
 people in Gdynia defuse the thing
 after it was put on board the ship,
 but otherwise leave it entirely alone.


 ""Actually, you see, your hunch was
 right on the button as far as it went.
 We didn't ask you whether or not
 that object was a live bomb. We
 asked whether it was a bomb or not.
 You said it was, and you were right.""


 The expression on Braun's face
 was exactly like the one he had worn
 while he had been searching for his
 decision—except that, since his eyes
 were open, I could see that it was
 directed at me. ""If this was the old
 days,"" he said in an ice-cold voice,
 ""I might of made the colonel's idea
 come true. I don't go for tricks like
 this, Andy.""


 ""It was more than a trick,"" Clark
 put in. ""You'll remember we had
 a deadline on the test, Mr. Braun.
 Obviously, in a real drop we wouldn't
 have all the time in the world
 to figure out what kind of a thing
 had been dropped. If we had still
 failed to establish that when the
 deadline ran out, we would have
 had to allow evacuation of the city,
 with all the attendant risk that that
 was exactly what the enemy wanted
 us to do.""


 ""So?""


 ""So we failed the test,"" I said. ""At
 one minute short of the deadline,
 Joan had the divers unscrew the cap.
 In a real drop that would have resulted
 in a detonation, if the bomb
 was real; we'd never risk it. That
 we did do it in the test was a concession
 of failure—an admission that
 our usual methods didn't come
 through for us in time.


 ""And that means that you were
 the only person who did come
 through, Mr. Braun. If a real bomb-drop
 ever comes, we're going to have
 to have you here, as an active part of
 our investigation. Your intuition for
 the one-shot gamble was the one
 thing that bailed us out this time.
 Next time it may save eight million
 lives.""


 There was quite a long silence. All
 of us, Anderton included, watched
 Braun intently, but his impassive
 face failed to show any trace of how
 his thoughts were running.


 When he did speak at last, what
 he said must have seemed insanely
 irrelevant to Anderton, and maybe
 to Cheyney too. And perhaps it
 meant nothing more to Joan than
 the final clinical note in a case history.


 ""It's funny,"" he said, ""I was
 thinking of running for Congress
 next year from my district. But maybe
 this is more important.""


 It was, I believe, the sigh of a man
 at peace with himself.

It was twilight on Venus—the rusty red that the eyes notice when
 their closed lids are raised to light. Against the glow, fantastically
 twisted trees spread claws of spiky leaves, and a group of clay huts
 thrust up sharp edges of shadow, like the abandoned toy blocks of a
 gigantic child. There was no sign of clear sky and stars—the heavens
 were roofed by a perpetual ceiling of dust-clouds.


 A light glimmered in one of the huts. Feminine voices rippled across
 the clearing and into the jungle. There was laughter, then someone's
 faint and wistful sigh. One of the voices mourned, in the twittering
 Venusian speech, ""How I envy you, Koroby! I wish I were being married
 tonight, like you!""


 Koroby stared defiantly at the laughing faces of her bridesmaids. She
 shrugged hopelessly. ""I don't care,"" she said slowly. ""It will be nice
 to have Yasak for a husband—yes. And perhaps I do love him. I don't
 know."" She tightened her lips as she reflected on it.


 She left them, moving gracefully to the door. Venus-girls were
 generally of truly elfin proportions, so delicately slim that they
 seemed incapable of the slightest exertion. But Koroby's body
 was—compared to her friends'—voluptuous.


 She rested against the door-frame, watching the red of the afterglow
 deepen to purple. ""I want romance,"" she said, so softly that the girls
 had to strain forward to hear her. ""I wish that there were other worlds
 than this—and that someone would drop out of the skies and claim
 me ... and take me away from here, away from all this—this monotony!""


 She turned back to her friends, went to them, one of her hands, patting
 the head of the kneeling one. She eyed herself in the mirror.


 ""Well—heigh-ho! There don't seem to be any other worlds, and nobody is
 going to steal me away from Yasak, so I might as well get on with my
 preparations. The men with the litter will be here soon to carry me to
 the Stone City.""


 She ran slim hands down her sides, smoothing the blue sarong; she
 fondled her dark braids. ""Trossa, how about some flowers at my ears—or
 do you think that it would look a little too much—?"" Her eyes sought
 the mirror, and her lips parted in an irreprehensible smile. She
 trilled softly to herself, ""Yes, I am beautiful tonight—the loveliest
 woman Yasak will ever see!"" And then, regretfully, sullenly, ""But oh,
 if only
He
would come ... the man of my dreams!""


 There was a rap at the doorway; they turned. One of the litter-bearers
 loomed darker than the gloomy sky. ""Are you ready?"" he asked.


 Koroby twirled before the mirror, criticizing her appearance. ""Yes,
 ready,"" she said.


 ""Ready!"" the girls cried. Then there was a little silence.


 ""Shall we go now?"" Koroby asked, and the litter-carrier nodded. Koroby
 kissed the girls, one after another. ""Here, Shonka—you can have this
 bracelet you've always liked. And this is for you, Lolla. And here,
 Trossa—and you, Shia. Goodbye, darlings, goodbye—come and see me
 whenever you can!""


 ""Goodbye, Koroby!""


 ""Goodbye! Goodbye!"" They crowded around her, embracing, babbling
 farewells, shreds of advice. Trossa began to cry. Finally Koroby broke
 away from them, went to the door. She took a last look at the interior
 of the little hut, dim in the lamplight—at the hard bed of laced
gnau
-hide strips, the crude but beautifully-carved charts and chests.
 Then she turned and stepped out into the night.


 ""This way,"" the litter-carrier announced, touching the girl's arm. They
 stumbled over the rutted clearing toward the twinkling sparks that were
 the lights of the other litter-bearers, colored sparks as befitted
 a wedding-conveyance. The winking lights were enclosed in shells of
 colored glass for another reason—the danger of their firing the papery
 jungle verdure.
It was not a new litter, built especially for the occasion—Yasak was
 too practical a man to sanction any kind of waste. It was the same
 old litter that Koroby had been watching come and go ever since she
 was a little girl, a canopied framework of gaudily-painted carvings.
 She had wondered, watching it pass, whether its cushioned floor was
 soft, and now, as she stepped into the litter, she patted the padding
 experimentally. Yes, it was soft .... And fragrant, too—a shade too
 fragrant. It smelled stale, hinting of other occupants, other brides
 being borne to other weddings....


 Garlands of flowers occupied a good deal of space in it. Settled among
 them, she felt like a bird in a strange nest. She leaned back among
 them; they rustled dryly. Too bad—it had been such a dry year—


 ""You're comfortable?"" the litter bearer asked. Koroby nodded, and the
 litter was lifted, was carried along the path.


 The procession filed into the jungle, into a tunnel of arched branches,
 of elephant-eared leaves. Above the monotonous music came the hiss of
 the torches, the occasional startled cry of a wakened bird. The glow of
 the flames, in the dusty air, hung around the party, sharply defined,
 like a cloak of light. At times a breeze would shake the ceiling of
 foliage, producing the sound of rolling surf.


 Koroby fingered the flowers around her throat, her eyes rapt on the
 passing trees. Her lips moved in the barest murmur: ""If only—!""
 and again, ""Oh, if only—!"" But the music trickled on, and nothing
 happened; the litter seemed to float along—none of the bearers even
 stumbled.


 They came to a cleared space of waist-high grass. It was like a canyon
 steeply walled by cliffs of verdure. The litter jerked as it glided
 along, and Koroby heard one of the bearers exclaim gruffly, ""Listen!""
 Then the litter resumed its dream-like floating on the backs of the men.


 ""What was it?"" another bearer asked.


 ""Thought I heard something,"" the other replied. ""Shrill and high—like
 something screaming—""


 Koroby peered out. ""A
gnau
?"" she asked.


 ""I don't know,"" the bearer volunteered.


 Koroby lifted a hand. ""Stop the litter,"" she said.
The conveyance halted. Koroby leaning out, the men peering around them,
 they listened. One of the bearers shouted at the musicians; the music
 ceased. There was nothing to be heard except the whisper of the breeze
 in the grass.


 Then the girl heard it—a shrill, distant whine, dying away, then
 growing louder—and louder—it seemed to be approaching—from the sky—


 All the faces were lifted up now, worriedly. The whine grew
 louder—Koroby's hands clenched nervously on the wreaths at her throat—


 Then, far ahead, a series of bright flashes, like the lightning of the
 dust-storms, but brilliantly green. A silence, then staccatto reports,
 certainly not thunder—unlike any sound that Koroby had ever heard.


 There was a babble of voices as the musicians crowded together, asking
 what had it been, and where—just exactly—could one suppose it had
 happened, that thunder—was it going to storm!


 They waited, but nothing further happened—there were no more stabs of
 green light nor detonations. The bearers stooped to lift the litter's
 poles to their shoulders. ""Shall we go on?"" one of them asked Koroby.


 She waved a hand. ""Yes, go on.""
The litter resumed its gentle swaying, but the music did not start
 again. Then, from the direction of the light-flashes, a glow appeared,
 shining steadily, green as the flashes had been. Noticing it, Koroby
 frowned. Then the path bent, and the glow swung to one side.


 Suddenly Koroby reached out, tapped the shoulder of the closet bearer.
 ""Go toward the light.""


 His face swung up to hers. ""But—there's no path that way—""


 ""I don't care,"" she said. ""Take me there."" Her order had reached the
 others' ears, and they slowed their pace.


 ""Lady—believe me—it's impossible. There's nothing but matted jungle
 in that direction—we'd have to hack our way as we go along. And who
 knows how far away that light is? Besides, you're on your way to be
 married.""


 ""Take me to that light!"" she persisted.


 They set the litter down. ""We can't do that,"" one man said to another.


 Koroby stepped out to the path, straightened up, her eyes on the glow.
 ""You'd better,"" she said ominously. ""Otherwise, I'll make a complaint
 to Yasak—""


 The men eyed each other, mentally shrugging. ""Well—"" one yielded.


 The girl whirled impatiently on the others. ""Hurry!"" she cried. ""If you
 won't take me, I'll go by myself. I must get to that fire, whatever it
 is!"" She put a hand to her heart. ""I must! I must!"" Then she faced the
 green glare again, smiling to herself.


 ""You can't do that!"" a carrier cried.


 ""Well, then, you take me,"" she said over her shoulder.


 Grumbling, they bent to the conveyance's poles, and Koroby lithely
 slipped to the cushions. They turned off the path, plodded through the
 deep grass toward the light. The litter lurched violently as their
 feet caught in the tangled grass, and clouds of fine dust arose from
 the disturbed blades.
By the time they reached the source of the light, they were quite
 demoralized. The musicians had not accompanied them, preferring to
 carry the message to Yasak in the Stone City that his prospective
 bride had gone off on a mad journey. The bearers were powdered grey
 with dust, striped with blood where the dry grass-stems had cut them.
 They were exhausted and panting. Koroby was walking beside them, for
 they had abandoned the litter finally. Her blue drapery was ripped and
 rumpled; her carefully-arranged braids had fallen loose; dust on her
 face had hid its youthful color, aging her.


 The expedition emerged from the jungle on a sandy stretch of barren
 land. A thousand feet away a gigantic metal object lay on the sand,
 crumpled as though it had dropped from a great distance. It had been
 globular before the crash, and was pierced with holes like windows.
 What could it possibly be? A house? But whoever heard of a metal house?
 Why, who could forge such a thing! Yasak's house in the City had iron
 doors, and they were considered one of the most wonderful things of the
 age. It would take a giant to make such a ponderous thing as this.


 A house, fallen from the sky? The green lights poured out of its
 crumpled part, and a strange bubbling and hissing filled the air.


 Koroby stopped short, clasping her hands and involuntarily uttering a
 squeal of joyful excitement, for between her and the blaze, his eyes on
 the destruction, stood a man.....


 He was very tall, and his shoulders were very wide. Oh, but he looked
 like a man, and stood like one—even though his hands were folded
 behind his back and he was probably dejected. A man in a house from the
 sky—


 Koroby hastily grasped a corner of her gown, moistened it with saliva,
 and scrubbed her face. She rearranged her hair, and stepped forward.


 ""Don't go there—it's magic—he'll cast a spell—!"" one of the bearers
 whispered urgently, reaching after her, but Koroby pushed him away. The
 litter-carriers watched the girl go, unconsciously huddling together
 as if feeling the need for combined strength. They withdrew into the
 jungle's shadows, and waited there anxiously, ready at any moment to
 run away.


 But Koroby, with supreme confidence, walked toward the stranger, her
 lovely body graceful as a cat's, her face radiant. The man did not hear
 her. She halted behind him, waited silent, expectant, excited—but he
 did not turn. The green fire sputtered upward. At last the girl stepped
 to the man's side and gently touched him again. He turned, and her
 heart faltered: she swayed with bliss.


 He was probably a god. Not even handsome Yasak looked like this. Here
 was a face so finely-chiseled, so perfectly proportioned, that it was
 almost frightening, unhuman, mechanical. It was unlined and without
 expression, somehow unreal. Mysterious, compelling.


 He was clothed very peculiarly. A wonderfully-made metallic garment
 enclosed his whole body—legs and all, unlike the Venus-men's tunics.
 Even his feet were covered. Perhaps it was armor—though the Venus-men
 usually wore only breastplate and greaves. And a helmet hid all of
 the man's head except his face. Around his waist was a belt with many
 incomprehensible objects dangling from it. If he was so well armored,
 why was he not carrying a sword—a dagger at least! Of what use were
 those things on his belt—for instance, that notched L-shaped thing? It
 would not even make a decent club!


 The stranger did not speak, merely gazed deeply into Koroby's eyes. And
 she, returning the gaze, wondered if he was peering into her very soul.
 The words of a folk-ballad came to her:

""—He'll smile and touch my cheek,
And maybe more;
And though we'll neither speak,
We'll know the score—""
Suddenly he put his hands to her cheeks and bent close to her, his eyes
 peering into hers as though he were searching for something he had lost
 in them. She spoke her thought: ""What are you doing? You seem to be
 reading my mind!""


 Without removing hands, he nodded. ""Reading—mind."" He stared long
 into her eyes. His dispassionate, too-perfect face began to frighten
 her. She slipped back from him, her hand clutching her throat.


 He straightened up and spoke—haltingly at first, then with growing
 assurance. ""Don't be afraid. I mean you no harm."" She trembled. It was
 such a wonderful voice—it was as she had always dreamed it! But she
 had never really believed in the dream....


 He was looking at the wrecked globe of metal. ""So there are people on
 Venus!"" he said slowly.


 Koroby watched him, forgot her fear, and went eagerly to him, took his
 arm. ""Who are you?"" she asked. ""Tell me your name!""


 He turned his mask of a face to her. ""My name? I have none,"" he said.


 ""No name? But who are you? Where are you from? And what is that?"" She
 pointed at the metal globe.


 ""The vehicle by which I came here from a land beyond the sky,"" he said.
 She had no concept of stars or space, and he could not fully explain.
 ""From a world known as Terra.""


 She was silent a moment, stunned. So there was another world! Then she
 asked, ""Is it far? Have you come to take me there?""


 Here the similarity between her dream and actual experience ended.
 What was he thinking as he eyed her for a long moment? She had no way
 of guessing. He said, ""No, I am not going to take you back there."" Her
 month gaped in surprise, and he continued, ""As for the distance to
 Terra—it is incredibly far away.""


 The glare was beginning to die, the green flames' hissing fading to a
 whisper. They watched the melting globe sag on the sand. Then Koroby
 said, ""But if it is so far away, how could you speak my language? There
 are some tribes beyond the jungle whose language is unlike ours—""


 ""I read your mind,"" he explained indifferently. ""I have a remarkable
 memory.""


 ""Remarkable indeed!"" she mocked. ""No one here could do that.""


 ""But my race is infinitely superior to yours,"" he said blandly. ""You
 little people—ah—"" He gestured airily.


 Her lips tightened and her eyes narrowed. ""And I?""


 His voice sounded almost surprised. ""What about you?""


 ""You see nothing about me worthy of your respect? Are you infinitely
 superior to me—
me
?""


 He looked her up and down. ""Of course!""


 Her eyes jerked wide open and she took a deep breath. ""And just who do
 you think you are? A god?""


 He shook his head. ""No. Just better informed, for one thing. And—""


 Koroby cut him short. ""What's your name?""


 ""I have none.""


 ""What do you mean, you have none?""


 He seemed just a trifle bored. ""We gave up names long ago on my world.
 We are concerned with more weighty things than our own selves. But I
 have a personal problem now,"" he said, making a peculiar sound that
 was not quite a sigh. ""Here I am stranded on Venus, my ship utterly
 wrecked, and I'm due at the Reisezek Convention in two weeks. You""—he
 gripped Koroby's shoulder, and his strength made her wince—""tell me,
 where is the nearest city? I must communicate with my people at once.""


 She pointed. ""The Stone City's that way.""


 ""Good,"" he said. ""Let's go there.""


 They took another glance at the metal globe and the green fire, which
 by now had died to a fitful glimmer. Then the stranger and the girl
 started toward the jungle, where the litter-bearers awaited them.
As the party was struggling through the prairie's tall grass, the man
 said to Koroby, ""I realize from the pictures in your mind that there
 is no means in your city of communicating directly with my people. But
 it seems that there are materials which I can utilize in building a
 signal—""


 He was walking along, head erect, apparently quite at ease, while the
 litter bearers and Koroby could barely drag themselves with him. The
 girl's garment was a tattered ruin. Her skin was gritty with dust, and
 she was bleeding from many scratches. She tripped over tangled roots
 and exclaimed in pain. Then the man took one of the strange implements
 from his belt, pressed a knob on it, and light appeared as if by magic!
 He handed the stick to Koroby, but she was afraid to touch it. This was
 a strange light that gave no heat, nor flickered in the breeze. Finally
 she accepted it from him, but carried it gingerly at arm's length.


 She refused to believe that he had no name, and so he named himself.
 ""Call me Robert. It is an ancient name on Terra.""


 ""Robert,"" she said, and, ""Robert.""


 But at last she could go no farther. She had forced herself along
 because she wanted to impress this indifferent man that she was not as
 inferior as he might think—but now she could not go on. With a little
 cry almost of relief, she sank to the ground and lay semi-conscious, so
 weary that the very pain of it seemed on the point of pleasure.


 Robert dipped down, scooped her up, and carried her.


 Lights glimmered ahead; shouts reached them. It was a searching party,
 Yasak in it. The litter-carriers who could still speak blurted out what
 had happened. ""A green light—loud sounds—fire—this man there—"" and
 then dropped into sleep.


 ""Someone carry these men,"" Yasak ordered. To Robert he said, ""We're not
 very far from the path to the City now. Shall I carry the girl?""


 ""It makes no difference,"" Robert said.


 ""You will stay with me while you are in the City, of course,"" Yasak
 said, as they walked. He eyed this handsome stranger speculatively, and
 then turned to shout an necessary order. ""You, there, keep in line!"" He
 glanced at Robert furtively to see if this had impressed him at all.
It was day. Koroby sat up in bed and scanned her surroundings. She was
 in Yasak's house. The bed was very soft, the coverlets of the finest
 weave. The furniture was elegantly carved and painted; there were even
 paintings on the walls.


 A woman came to the bed. She was stocky and wore drab grey: the blue
 circles tattooed on her cheeks proclaimed her a slave. ""How do you
 feel?"" she asked.


 ""Fairly well. How long have I been ill?"" Koroby asked, sweetly weak.


 ""You haven't been ill. They brought you in last night.""


 ""Oh,"" Koroby said disappointedly, and sat upright. ""I feel as if I'd
 been lying here for weeks. Where's Yasak? Where's the strange man in
 armor?""


 ""Yasak's out somewhere. The stranger man is in the room at the end of
 the hall.""


 ""Fetch me something to wear—that's good enough,"" the girl accepted the
 mantle offered by the slave. ""Quick, some water—I must wash.""


 In a few minutes she was lightly running down the hall; she knocked on
 the door of Robert's room. ""May I come in?""


 He did not answer. She waited a little and went in. He was seated on
 one of the carved chairs, fussing over some scraps of metal on the
 table. He did not look up.


 ""Thank you for carrying me, Robert."" He did not reply. ""Robert—I
 dreamed of you last night. I dreamed you built another round house and
 that we both flew away in it. Yasak had to stay behind, and he was
 furious. Robert! Aren't you listening?""


 ""I hear you.""


 ""Don't you think it was an exciting dream?"" He shook his head. ""But
 why? Robert""—she laid longing hands on his shoulders—""can't you see
 that I'm in love with you?"" He shrugged. ""I believe you don't know what
 love is!""


 ""I had a faint idea of it when I looked into your mind,"" he said. ""I'm
 afraid I haven't any use for it. Where I come from there is no love,
 and there shouldn't be here, either. It's a waste of time.""


 ""Robert—I'm mad about you! I've dreamed of your coming—all my life!
 Don't be so cruel—so cold to me! You mock me, say that I'm nothing,
 that I'm not worthy of you—""


 She stepped back from him, clenching her hands. ""Oh, I hate you—hate
 you! You don't care the least bit about me—and I've shamed myself in
 front of you—I, supposed to be Yasak's wife by now!"" She began to
 cry, hid her face in suddenly lax fingers. She looked up fiercely. ""I
 could kill you!"" Robert stood immobile, no trace of feeling marring the
 perfection of his face. ""I could kill you, and I will kill you!"" she
 sprang at him.


 ""You'll hurt yourself,"" he admonished kindly, and after she had
 pummeled his chest, bruising her fingers on his armor, she turned away.


 ""And now if you're through playing your incomprehensible little scene,""
 Robert said, ""I hope you will excuse me. I regret that I have no
 emotions—I was never allowed them. But it is an esthetic regret.... I
 must go back to my wrecked ship now and arrange the signals there."" He
 did not wait for her leave, but strode out of the room.


 Koroby huddled on a chair, sobbing. Then she dried her eyes on the
 backs of her hands. She went to the narrow slits that served as windows
 and unfastened the translucent shutter of one. Down in the City street,
 Robert was walking away. Her eyes hardened, and her fingers spread
 into ugly claws. Without bothering to pull the shutter in place she
 hurried out of the room, ran eagerly down the hall. She stopped at
 the armor-rack at the main hall on her way outside, and snatched up a
siatcha
—a firestone. Then she slipped outside and down the street.
The City's wall was not far behind. Robert was visible in the distance,
 striding toward his sky-ship, a widening cloud of dust rising behind
 him like the spreading wake of a boat. Koroby stood on tip-toe, waving
 and calling after him, ""Robert! Robert! Come back!"" but he did not seem
 to hear.


 She watched him a little longer. Then she deliberately stooped and drew
 the firestone out of its sheath. She touched it to a blade of the tall
 grass. A little orange flame licked up, slowly quested along the blade,
 down to the ground and up another stem. It slipped over to another
 stem, and another, growing larger, hotter—Koroby stepped back from the
 writhing fire, her hand protectively over her face.


 The flames crackled at first—like the crumpling of thin paper. Then,
 as they widened and began climbing hand over hand up an invisible
 ladder, they roared. Koroby was running back toward the City now, away
 from the heat. The fire spread in a long line over the prairie. Above
 its roar came shouts from the City. The flames rose in a monstrous
 twisting pillar, brighter than even the dust-palled sky, lighting the
 buildings and the prairie. The heat was dreadful.


 Koroby reached the City wall, panted through the gate into a shrieking
 crowd. Someone grasped her roughly—she was too breathless to do more
 than gasp for air—and shook her violently. ""You fool, you utter
 fool! What did you think you were doing?"" Others clamored around her,
 reaching for her. Then she heard Yasak's voice. Face stern, he pushed
 through the crowd, pressed her to him. ""Let her alone—Let her alone, I
 say!""


 They watched the conflagration, Yasak and Koroby, from a higher part of
 the wall than where the others were gathered. They could glimpse Robert
 now and then. He was running, trying to outrace the flames. Then they
 swept around him, circling him—his arms flailed frantically.
The fire had passed over the horizon. The air was blue with smoke,
 difficult to breathe, and ashes were drifting lightly down like
 dove-colored snow. Yasak, watery eyed, a cloth pressed to his nose, was
 walking with several others over the smoking earth and still warm ashes
 up to his knees. In one hand he held a stick. He stopped and pointed.
 ""He fell about here,"" he said, and began to probe the ashes with the
 stick.


 He struck something. ""Here he is!"" he cried. The others hurried to the
 spot and scooped ashes away, dog-fashion, until Robert's remains were
 laid clear. There were exclamations of amazement and perplexity from
 the people.


 It was a metal skeleton, and the fragments of complicated machinery,
 caked with soot.


 ""He wasn't human at all!"" Yasak marvelled. ""He was some kind of a toy
 made to look like a man—that's why he wore armor, and his face never
 changed expression—""


 ""Magic!"" someone cried, and backed away.


 ""Magic!"" the others repeated, and edged back ... and that was the
 end of one of those robots which had been fashioned as servants for
 Terrestial men, made in Man's likeness to appease Man's vanity, then
 conquered him.

Silently, so as not to shock anyone with illusions about well dressed
 young women, Sandra Lea Grayling cursed the day she had persuaded the
Chicago Space Mirror
that there would be all sorts of human interest
 stories to be picked up at the first international grandmaster chess
 tournament in which an electronic computing machine was entered.


 Not that there weren't enough humans around, it was the interest that
 was in doubt. The large hall was crammed with energetic dark-suited
 men of whom a disproportionately large number were bald, wore glasses,
 were faintly untidy and indefinably shabby, had Slavic or Scandinavian
 features, and talked foreign languages.


 They yakked interminably. The only ones who didn't were scurrying
 individuals with the eager-zombie look of officials.


 Chess sets were everywhere—big ones on tables, still bigger
 diagram-type electric ones on walls, small peg-in sets dragged from
 side pockets and manipulated rapidly as part of the conversational
 ritual and still smaller folding sets in which the pieces were the tiny
 magnetized disks used for playing in free-fall.


 There were signs featuring largely mysterious combinations of letters:
 FIDE, WBM, USCF, USSF, USSR and UNESCO. Sandra felt fairly sure about
 the last three.


 The many clocks, bedside table size, would have struck a familiar
 note except that they had little red flags and wheels sprinkled over
 their faces and they were all in pairs, two clocks to a case. That
 Siamese-twin clocks should be essential to a chess tournament struck
 Sandra as a particularly maddening circumstance.
Her last assignment had been to interview the pilot pair riding the
 first American manned circum-lunar satellite—and the five alternate
 pairs who hadn't made the flight. This tournament hall seemed to Sandra
 much further out of the world.


 Overheard scraps of conversation in reasonably intelligible English
 were not particularly helpful. Samples:


 ""They say the Machine has been programmed to play nothing but pure
 Barcza System and Indian Defenses—and the Dragon Formation if anyone
 pushes the King Pawn.""


 ""Hah! In that case....""


 ""The Russians have come with ten trunkfuls of prepared variations and
 they'll gang up on the Machine at adjournments. What can one New Jersey
 computer do against four Russian grandmasters?""


 ""I heard the Russians have been programmed—with hypnotic cramming and
 somno-briefing. Votbinnik had a nervous breakdown.""


 ""Why, the Machine hasn't even a
Haupturnier
or an intercollegiate
 won. It'll over its head be playing.""


 ""Yes, but maybe like Capa at San Sebastian or Morphy or Willie Angler
 at New York. The Russians will look like potzers.""


 ""Have you studied the scores of the match between Moon Base and
 Circum-Terra?""


 ""Not worth the trouble. The play was feeble. Barely Expert Rating.""


 Sandra's chief difficulty was that she knew absolutely nothing about
 the game of chess—a point that she had slid over in conferring with
 the powers at the
Space Mirror
, but that now had begun to weigh on
 her. How wonderful it would be, she dreamed, to walk out this minute,
 find a quiet bar and get pie-eyed in an evil, ladylike way.
""Perhaps mademoiselle would welcome a drink?""


 ""You're durn tootin' she would!"" Sandra replied in a rush, and then
 looked down apprehensively at the person who had read her thoughts.


 It was a small sprightly elderly man who looked like a somewhat
 thinned down Peter Lorre—there was that same impression of the happy
 Slavic elf. What was left of his white hair was cut very short,
 making a silvery nap. His pince-nez had quite thick lenses. But in
 sharp contrast to the somberly clad men around them, he was wearing
 a pearl-gray suit of almost exactly the same shade as Sandra's—a
 circumstance that created for her the illusion that they were fellow
 conspirators.


 ""Hey, wait a minute,"" she protested just the same. He had already taken
 her arm and was piloting her toward the nearest flight of low wide
 stairs. ""How did you know I wanted a drink?""


 ""I could see that mademoiselle was having difficulty swallowing,"" he
 replied, keeping them moving. ""Pardon me for feasting my eyes on your
 lovely throat.""


 ""I didn't suppose they'd serve drinks here.""


 ""But of course."" They were already mounting the stairs. ""What would
 chess be without coffee or schnapps?""


 ""Okay, lead on,"" Sandra said. ""You're the doctor.""


 ""Doctor?"" He smiled widely. ""You know, I like being called that.""


 ""Then the name is yours as long as you want it—Doc.""
Meanwhile the happy little man had edged them into the first of a small
 cluster of tables, where a dark-suited jabbering trio was just rising.
 He snapped his fingers and hissed through his teeth. A white-aproned
 waiter materialized.


 ""For myself black coffee,"" he said. ""For mademoiselle rhine wine and
 seltzer?""


 ""That'd go fine."" Sandra leaned back. ""Confidentially, Doc, I was
 having trouble swallowing ... well, just about everything here.""


 He nodded. ""You are not the first to be shocked and horrified by
 chess,"" he assured her. ""It is a curse of the intellect. It is a game
 for lunatics—or else it creates them. But what brings a sane and
 beautiful young lady to this 64-square madhouse?""


 Sandra briefly told him her story and her predicament. By the time they
 were served, Doc had absorbed the one and assessed the other.


 ""You have one great advantage,"" he told her. ""You know nothing
 whatsoever of chess—so you will be able to write about it
 understandably for your readers."" He swallowed half his demitasse and
 smacked his lips. ""As for the Machine—you
do
know, I suppose, that
 it is not a humanoid metal robot, walking about clanking and squeaking
 like a late medieval knight in armor?""


 ""Yes, Doc, but...."" Sandra found difficulty in phrasing the question.


 ""Wait."" He lifted a finger. ""I think I know what you're going to ask.
 You want to know why, if the Machine works at all, it doesn't work
 perfectly, so that it always wins and there is no contest. Right?""


 Sandra grinned and nodded. Doc's ability to interpret her mind was as
 comforting as the bubbly, mildly astringent mixture she was sipping.


 He removed his pince-nez, massaged the bridge of his nose and replaced
 them.


 ""If you had,"" he said, ""a billion computers all as fast as the Machine,
 it would take them all the time there ever will be in the universe just
 to play through all the possible games of chess, not to mention the
 time needed to classify those games into branching families of wins for
 White, wins for Black and draws, and the additional time required to
 trace out chains of key-moves leading always to wins. So the Machine
 can't play chess like God. What the Machine can do is examine all the
 likely lines of play for about eight moves ahead—that is, four moves
 each for White and Black—and then decide which is the best move on the
 basis of capturing enemy pieces, working toward checkmate, establishing
 a powerful central position and so on.""
""That sounds like the way a man would play a game,"" Sandra observed.
 ""Look ahead a little way and try to make a plan. You know, like getting
 out trumps in bridge or setting up a finesse.""


 ""Exactly!"" Doc beamed at her approvingly. ""The Machine
is
like a
 man. A rather peculiar and not exactly pleasant man. A man who always
 abides by sound principles, who is utterly incapable of flights of
 genius, but who never makes a mistake. You see, you are finding human
 interest already, even in the Machine.""


 Sandra nodded. ""Does a human chess player—a grandmaster, I mean—ever
 look eight moves ahead in a game?""


 ""Most assuredly he does! In crucial situations, say where there's a
 chance of winning at once by trapping the enemy king, he examines
 many more moves ahead than that—thirty or forty even. The Machine
 is probably programmed to recognize such situations and do something
 of the same sort, though we can't be sure from the information World
 Business Machines has released. But in most chess positions the
 possibilities are so very nearly unlimited that even a grandmaster can
 only look a very few moves ahead and must rely on his judgment and
 experience and artistry. The equivalent of those in the Machine is the
 directions fed into it before it plays a game.""


 ""You mean the programming?""


 ""Indeed yes! The programming is the crux of the problem of the
 chess-playing computer. The first practical model, reported by
 Bernstein and Roberts of IBM in 1958 and which looked four moves
 ahead, was programmed so that it had a greedy worried tendency to grab
 at enemy pieces and to retreat its own whenever they were attacked. It
 had a personality like that of a certain kind of chess-playing dub—a
 dull-brained woodpusher afraid to take the slightest risk of losing
 material—but a dub who could almost always beat an utter novice.
 The WBM machine here in the hall operates about a million times as
 fast. Don't ask me how, I'm no physicist, but it depends on the new
 transistors and something they call hypervelocity, which in turn
 depends on keeping parts of the Machine at a temperature near absolute
 zero. However, the result is that the Machine can see eight moves ahead
 and is capable of being programmed much more craftily.""


 ""A million times as fast as the first machine, you say, Doc? And yet it
 only sees twice as many moves ahead?"" Sandra objected.


 ""There is a geometrical progression involved there,"" he told her
 with a smile. ""Believe me, eight moves ahead is a lot of moves when
 you remember that the Machine is errorlessly examining every one of
 thousands of variations. Flesh-and-blood chess masters have lost games
 by blunders they could have avoided by looking only one or two moves
 ahead. The Machine will make no such oversights. Once again, you see,
 you have the human factor, in this case working for the Machine.""


 ""Savilly, I have been looking allplace for you!""


 A stocky, bull-faced man with a great bristling shock of black,
 gray-flecked hair had halted abruptly by their table. He bent over Doc
 and began to whisper explosively in a guttural foreign tongue.
Sandra's gaze traveled beyond the balustrade. Now that she could look
 down at it, the central hall seemed less confusedly crowded. In the
 middle, toward the far end, were five small tables spaced rather widely
 apart and with a chessboard and men and one of the Siamese clocks set
 out on each. To either side of the hall were tiers of temporary seats,
 about half of them occupied. There were at least as many more people
 still wandering about.


 On the far wall was a big electric scoreboard and also, above the
 corresponding tables, five large dully glassy chessboards, the White
 squares in light gray, the Black squares in dark.


 One of the five wall chessboards was considerably larger than the other
 four—the one above the Machine.


 Sandra looked with quickening interest at the console of the Machine—a
 bank of keys and some half-dozen panels of rows and rows of tiny
 telltale lights, all dark at the moment. A thick red velvet cord on
 little brass standards ran around the Machine at a distance of about
 ten feet. Inside the cord were only a few gray-smocked men. Two of
 them had just laid a black cable to the nearest chess table and were
 attaching it to the Siamese clock.


 Sandra tried to think of a being who always checked everything, but
 only within limits beyond which his thoughts never ventured, and who
 never made a mistake....


 ""Miss Grayling! May I present to you Igor Jandorf.""


 She turned back quickly with a smile and a nod.


 ""I should tell you, Igor,"" Doc continued, ""that Miss Grayling
 represents a large and influential Midwestern newspaper. Perhaps you
 have a message for her readers.""


 The shock-headed man's eyes flashed. ""I most certainly do!"" At that
 moment the waiter arrived with a second coffee and wine-and-seltzer.
 Jandorf seized Doc's new demitasse, drained it, set it back on the tray
 with a flourish and drew himself up.
""Tell your readers, Miss Grayling,"" he proclaimed, fiercely arching his
 eyebrows at her and actually slapping his chest, ""that I, Igor Jandorf,
 will defeat the Machine by the living force of my human personality!
 Already I have offered to play it an informal game blindfold—I, who
 have played 50 blindfold games simultaneously! Its owners refuse me. I
 have challenged it also to a few games of rapid-transit—an offer no
 true grandmaster would dare ignore. Again they refuse me. I predict
 that the Machine will play like a great oaf—at least against
me
.
 Repeat: I, Igor Jandorf, by the living force of my human personality,
 will defeat the Machine. Do you have that? You can remember it?""


 ""Oh yes,"" Sandra assured him, ""but there are some other questions I
 very much want to ask you, Mr. Jandorf.""


 ""I am sorry, Miss Grayling, but I must clear my mind now. In ten
 minutes they start the clocks.""


 While Sandra arranged for an interview with Jandorf after the day's
 playing session, Doc reordered his coffee.


 ""One expects it of Jandorf,"" he explained to Sandra with a philosophic
 shrug when the shock-headed man was gone. ""At least he didn't take your
 wine-and-seltzer. Or did he? One tip I have for you: don't call a chess
 master Mister, call him Master. They all eat it up.""


 ""Gee, Doc, I don't know how to thank you for everything. I hope I
 haven't offended Mis—Master Jandorf so that he doesn't—""


 ""Don't worry about that. Wild horses couldn't keep Jandorf away from a
 press interview. You know, his rapid-transit challenge was cunning.
 That's a minor variety of chess where each player gets only ten seconds
 to make a move. Which I don't suppose would give the Machine time to
 look three moves ahead. Chess players would say that the Machine has a
 very slow sight of the board. This tournament is being played at the
 usual international rate of 15 moves an hour, and—""


 ""Is that why they've got all those crazy clocks?"" Sandra interrupted.


 ""Oh, yes. Chess clocks measure the time each player takes in making his
 moves. When a player makes a move he presses a button that shuts his
 clock off and turns his opponent's on. If a player uses too much time,
 he loses as surely as if he were checkmated. Now since the Machine
 will almost certainly be programmed to take an equal amount of time
 on successive moves, a rate of 15 moves an hour means it will have 4
 minutes a move—and it will need every second of them! Incidentally
 it was typical Jandorf bravado to make a point of a blindfold
 challenge—just as if the Machine weren't playing blindfold itself. Or
is
the Machine blindfold? How do you think of it?""


 ""Gosh, I don't know. Say, Doc, is it really true that Master Jandorf
 has played 50 games at once blindfolded? I can't believe that.""
""Of course not!"" Doc assured her. ""It was only 49 and he lost two of
 those and drew five. Jandorf always exaggerates. It's in his blood.""


 ""He's one of the Russians, isn't he?"" Sandra asked. ""Igor?""


 Doc chuckled. ""Not exactly,"" he said gently. ""He is originally a Pole
 and now he has Argentinian citizenship. You have a program, don't you?""


 Sandra started to hunt through her pocketbook, but just then two lists
 of names lit up on the big electric scoreboard.

 ""Cripes, Doc, they all sound like they were Russians,"" Sandra said
 after a bit. ""Except this Willie Angler. Oh, he's the boy wonder,
 isn't he?""


 Doc nodded. ""Not such a boy any longer, though. He's.... Well, speak of
 the Devil's children.... Miss Grayling, I have the honor of presenting
 to you the only grandmaster ever to have been ex-chess-champion of the
 United States while still technically a minor—Master William Augustus
 Angler.""


 A tall, sharply-dressed young man with a hatchet face pressed the old
 man back into his chair.


 ""How are you, Savvy, old boy old boy?"" he demanded. ""Still chasing the
 girls, I see.""


 ""Please, Willie, get off me.""


 ""Can't take it, huh?"" Angler straightened up somewhat. ""Hey waiter!
 Where's that chocolate malt? I don't want it
next
year. About that
ex-
, though. I was swindled, Savvy. I was robbed.""


 ""Willie!"" Doc said with some asperity. ""Miss Grayling is a journalist.
 She would like to have a statement from you as to how you will play
 against the Machine.""
Angler grinned and shook his head sadly. ""Poor old Machine,"" he said.
 ""I don't know why they take so much trouble polishing up that pile of
 tin just so that I can give it a hit in the head. I got a hatful of
 moves it'll burn out all its tubes trying to answer. And if it gets too
 fresh, how about you and me giving its low-temperature section the
 hotfoot, Savvy? The money WBM's putting up is okay, though. That first
 prize will just fit the big hole in my bank account.""


 ""I know you haven't the time now, Master Angler,"" Sandra said rapidly,
 ""but if after the playing session you could grant me—""


 ""Sorry, babe,"" Angler broke in with a wave of dismissal. ""I'm dated up
 for two months in advance. Waiter! I'm here, not there!"" And he went
 charging off.


 Doc and Sandra looked at each other and smiled.


 ""Chess masters aren't exactly humble people, are they?"" she said.


 Doc's smile became tinged with sad understanding. ""You must excuse
 them, though,"" he said. ""They really get so little recognition or
 recompense. This tournament is an exception. And it takes a great deal
 of ego to play greatly.""


 ""I suppose so. So World Business Machines is responsible for this
 tournament?""


 ""Correct. Their advertising department is interested in the prestige.
 They want to score a point over their great rival.""


 ""But if the Machine plays badly it will be a black eye for them,""
 Sandra pointed out.


 ""True,"" Doc agreed thoughtfully. ""WBM must feel very sure.... It's
 the prize money they've put up, of course, that's brought the world's
 greatest players here. Otherwise half of them would be holding off
 in the best temperamental-artist style. For chess players the prize
 money is fabulous—$35,000, with $15,000 for first place, and all
 expenses paid for all players. There's never been anything like it.
 Soviet Russia is the only country that has ever supported and rewarded
 her best chess players at all adequately. I think the Russian players
 are here because UNESCO and FIDE (that's
Federation Internationale
 des Echecs
—the international chess organization) are also backing
 the tournament. And perhaps because the Kremlin is hungry for a little
 prestige now that its space program is sagging.""


 ""But if a Russian doesn't take first place it will be a black eye for
 them.""


 Doc frowned. ""True, in a sense.
They
must feel very sure.... Here
 they are now.""
Four men were crossing the center of the hall, which was clearing,
 toward the tables at the other end. Doubtless they just happened to be
 going two by two in close formation, but it gave Sandra the feeling of
 a phalanx.


 ""The first two are Lysmov and Votbinnik,"" Doc told her. ""It isn't often
 that you see the current champion of the world—Votbinnik—and an
 ex-champion arm in arm. There are two other persons in the tournament
 who have held that honor—Jal and Vanderhoef the director, way back.""


 ""Will whoever wins this tournament become champion?""


 ""Oh no. That's decided by two-player matches—a very long
 business—after elimination tournaments between leading contenders.
 This tournament is a round robin: each player plays one game with every
 other player. That means nine rounds.""


 ""Anyway there
are
an awful lot of Russians in the tournament,""
 Sandra said, consulting her program. ""Four out of ten have USSR after
 them. And Bela Grabo, Hungary—that's a satellite. And Sherevsky and
 Krakatower are Russian-sounding names.""


 ""The proportion of Soviet to American entries in the tournament
 represents pretty fairly the general difference in playing strength
 between the two countries,"" Doc said judiciously. ""Chess mastery
 moves from land to land with the years. Way back it was the Moslems
 and the Hindus and Persians. Then Italy and Spain. A little over a
 hundred years ago it was France and England. Then Germany, Austria
 and the New World. Now it's Russia—including of course the Russians
 who have run away from Russia. But don't think there aren't a lot of
 good Anglo-Saxon types who are masters of the first water. In fact,
 there are a lot of them here around us, though perhaps you don't
 think so. It's just that if you play a lot of chess you get to looking
 Russian. Once it probably made you look Italian. Do you see that short
 bald-headed man?""


 ""You mean the one facing the Machine and talking to Jandorf?""


 ""Yes. Now that's one with a lot of human interest. Moses Sherevsky.
 Been champion of the United States many times. A very strict Orthodox
 Jew. Can't play chess on Fridays or on Saturdays before sundown."" He
 chuckled. ""Why, there's even a story going around that one rabbi told
 Sherevsky it would be unlawful for him to play against the Machine
 because it is technically a
golem
—the clay Frankenstein's monster of
 Hebrew legend.""


 Sandra asked, ""What about Grabo and Krakatower?""
Doc gave a short scornful laugh. ""Krakatower! Don't pay any attention
 to
him
. A senile has-been, it's a scandal he's been allowed to play
 in this tournament! He must have pulled all sorts of strings. Told them
 that his lifelong services to chess had won him the honor and that they
 had to have a member of the so-called Old Guard. Maybe he even got down
 on his knees and cried—and all the time his eyes on that expense money
 and the last-place consolation prize! Yet dreaming schizophrenically
 of beating them all! Please, don't get me started on Dirty Old
 Krakatower.""


 ""Take it easy, Doc. He sounds like he would make an interesting
 article? Can you point him out to me?""


 ""You can tell him by his long white beard with coffee stains. I don't
 see it anywhere, though. Perhaps he's shaved it off for the occasion.
 It would be like that antique womanizer to develop senile delusions of
 youthfulness.""


 ""And Grabo?"" Sandra pressed, suppressing a smile at the intensity of
 Doc's animosity.


 Doc's eyes grew thoughtful. ""About Bela Grabo (why are three out of
 four Hungarians named Bela?) I will tell you only this: That he is a
 very brilliant player and that the Machine is very lucky to have drawn
 him as its first opponent.""


 He would not amplify his statement. Sandra studied the Scoreboard again.


 ""This Simon Great who's down as programming the Machine. He's a famous
 physicist, I suppose?""


 ""By no means. That was the trouble with some of the early chess-playing
 machines—they were programmed by scientists. No, Simon Great is a
 psychologist who at one time was a leading contender for the world's
 chess championship. I think WBM was surprisingly shrewd to pick him
 for the programming job. Let me tell you—No, better yet—""


 Doc shot to his feet, stretched an arm on high and called out sharply,
 ""Simon!""


 A man some four tables away waved back and a moment later came over.


 ""What is it, Savilly?"" he asked. ""There's hardly any time, you know.""
The newcomer was of middle height, compact of figure and feature, with
 graying hair cut short and combed sharply back.


 Doc spoke his piece for Sandra.


 Simon Great smiled thinly. ""Sorry,"" he said, ""But I am making no
 predictions and we are giving out no advance information on the
 programming of the Machine. As you know, I have had to fight the
 Players' Committee tooth and nail on all sorts of points about that
 and they have won most of them. I am not permitted to re-program the
 Machine at adjournments—only between games (I did insist on that and
 get it!) And if the Machine breaks down during a game, its clock keeps
 running on it. My men are permitted to make repairs—if they can work
 fast enough.""


 ""That makes it very tough on you,"" Sandra put in. ""The Machine isn't
 allowed any weaknesses.""


 Great nodded soberly. ""And now I must go. They've almost finished the
 count-down, as one of my technicians keeps on calling it. Very pleased
 to have met you, Miss Grayling—I'll check with our PR man on that
 interview. Be seeing you, Savvy.""


 The tiers of seats were filled now and the central space almost clear.
 Officials were shooing off a few knots of lingerers. Several of the
 grandmasters, including all four Russians, were seated at their tables.
 Press and company cameras were flashing. The four smaller wallboards
 lit up with the pieces in the opening position—white for White and red
 for Black. Simon Great stepped over the red velvet cord and more flash
 bulbs went off.


 ""You know, Doc,"" Sandra said, ""I'm a dog to suggest this, but what
 if this whole thing were a big fake? What if Simon Great were really
 playing the Machine's moves? There would surely be some way for his
 electricians to rig—""


 Doc laughed happily—and so loudly that some people at the adjoining
 tables frowned.


 ""Miss Grayling, that is a wonderful idea! I will probably steal it for
 a short story. I still manage to write and place a few in England.
 No, I do not think that is at all likely. WBM would never risk such
 a fraud. Great is completely out of practice for actual tournament
 play, though not for chess-thinking. The difference in style between
 a computer and a man would be evident to any expert. Great's own style
 is remembered and would be recognized—though, come to think of it, his
 style was often described as being machinelike...."" For a moment Doc's
 eyes became thoughtful. Then he smiled again. ""But no, the idea is
 impossible. Vanderhoef as Tournament Director has played two or three
 games with the Machine to assure himself that it operates legitimately
 and has grandmaster skill.""


 ""Did the Machine beat him?"" Sandra asked.
Doc shrugged. ""The scores weren't released. It was very hush-hush.
 But about your idea, Miss Grayling—did you ever read about Maelzel's
 famous chess-playing automaton of the 19th Century? That one too was
 supposed to work by machinery (cogs and gears, not electricity) but
 actually it had a man hidden inside it—your Edgar Poe exposed the
 fraud in a famous article. In
my
story I think the chess robot will
 break down while it is being demonstrated to a millionaire purchaser
 and the young inventor will have to win its game for it to cover up
 and swing the deal. Only the millionaire's daughter, who is really a
 better player than either of them ... yes, yes! Your Ambrose Bierce
 too wrote a story about a chess-playing robot of the clickety-clank-grr
 kind who murdered his creator, crushing him like an iron grizzly bear
 when the man won a game from him. Tell me, Miss Grayling, do you find
 yourself imagining this Machine putting out angry tendrils to strangle
 its opponents, or beaming rays of death and hypnotism at them? I can
 imagine....""


 While Doc chattered happily on about chess-playing robots and chess
 stories, Sandra found herself thinking about him. A writer of some sort
 evidently and a terrific chess buff. Perhaps he was an actual medical
 doctor. She'd read something about two or three coming over with the
 Russian squad. But Doc certainly didn't sound like a Soviet citizen.


 He was older than she'd first assumed. She could see that now that
 she was listening to him less and looking at him more. Tired, too.
 Only his dark-circled eyes shone with unquenchable youth. A useful old
 guy, whoever he was. An hour ago she'd been sure she was going to muff
 this assignment completely and now she had it laid out cold. For the
 umpteenth time in her career Sandra shied away from the guilty thought
 that she wasn't a writer at all or even a reporter, she just used
 dime-a-dozen female attractiveness to rope a susceptible man (young,
 old, American, Russian) and pick his brain....


 She realized suddenly that the whole hall had become very quiet.


 Doc was the only person still talking and people were again looking at
 them disapprovingly. All five wallboards were lit up and the changed
 position of a few pieces showed that opening moves had been made on
 four of them, including the Machine's. The central space between
 the tiers of seats was completely clear now, except for one man
 hurrying across it in their direction with the rapid yet quiet, almost
 tip-toe walk that seemed to mark all the officials.
Like morticians'
 assistants
, she thought. He rapidly mounted the stairs and halted at
 the top to look around searchingly. His gaze lighted on their table,
 his eyebrows went up, and he made a beeline for Doc. Sandra wondered if
 she should warn him that he was about to be shushed.


 The official laid a hand on Doc's shoulder. ""Sir!"" he said agitatedly.
 ""Do you realize that they've started your clock, Dr. Krakatower?""

Granthan's mission was the most vital of the war.

 It would mean instant victory—but for whom?
I


 In the dream I was swimming in a river of white fire and the dream went
 on and on. And then I was awake—and the fire was still there, fiercely
 burning at me.


 I tried to move to get away from the flames, and then the real pain
 hit me. I tried to go back to sleep and the relative comfort of the
 river of fire, but it was no go. For better or worse, I was alive and
 conscious.


 I opened my eyes and took a look around. I was on the floor next to
 an unpadded acceleration couch—the kind the Terrestrial Space Arm
 installs in seldom-used lifeboats. There were three more couches, but
 no one in them. I tried to sit up. It wasn't easy but, by applying a
 lot more will-power than should be required of a sick man, I made it.
 I took a look at my left arm. Baked. The hand was only medium rare,
 but the forearm was black, with deep red showing at the bottom of the
 cracks where the crisped upper layers had burst....


 There was a first-aid cabinet across the compartment from me. I
 tried my right leg, felt broken bone-ends grate with a sensation
 that transcended pain. I heaved with the other leg, scrabbled with
 the charred arm. The crawl to the cabinet dwarfed Hillary's trek
 up Everest, but I reached it after a couple of years, and found the
 microswitch on the floor that activated the thing, and then I was
 fading out again....
I came out of it clear-headed but weak. My right leg was numb, but
 reasonably comfortable, clamped tight in a walking brace. I put up
 a hand and felt a shaved skull, with sutures. It must have been a
 fracture. The left arm—well, it was still there, wrapped to the
 shoulder and held out stiffly by a power truss that would keep the scar
 tissue from pulling up and crippling me. The steady pressure as the
 truss contracted wasn't anything to do a sense-tape on for replaying at
 leisure moments, but at least the cabinet hadn't amputated. I wasn't
 complaining.


 As far as I knew, I was the first recorded survivor of contact with the
 Gool—if I survived.


 I was still a long way from home, and I hadn't yet checked on the
 condition of the lifeboat. I glanced toward the entry port. It was
 dogged shut. I could see black marks where my burned hand had been at
 work.


 I fumbled my way into a couch and tried to think. In my condition—with
 a broken leg and third-degree burns, plus a fractured skull—I
 shouldn't have been able to fall out of bed, much less make the trip
 from
Belshazzar's
CCC to the boat; and how had I managed to dog that
 port shut? In an emergency a man was capable of great exertions. But
 running on a broken femur, handling heavy levers with charred fingers
 and thinking with a cracked head were overdoing it. Still, I was
 here—and it was time to get a call through to TSA headquarters.


 I flipped the switch and gave the emergency call-letters Col. Ausar
 Kayle of Aerospace Intelligence had assigned to me a few weeks before.
 It was almost five minutes before the ""acknowledge"" came through from
 the Ganymede relay station, another ten minutes before Kayle's face
 swam into view. Even through the blur of the screen I could see the
 haggard look.


 ""Granthan!"" he burst out. ""Where are the others? What happened out
 there?"" I turned him down to a mutter.


 ""Hold on,"" I said. ""I'll tell you. Recorders going?"" I didn't wait for
 an answer—not with a fifteen-minute transmission lag. I plowed on:


 ""
Belshazzar
was sabotaged. So was
Gilgamesh
—I think. I got out. I
 lost a little skin, but the aid cabinet has the case in hand. Tell the
 Med people the drinks are on me.""


 I finished talking and flopped back, waiting for Kayle's reply. On the
 screen, his flickering image gazed back impatiently, looking as hostile
 as a swing-shift ward nurse. It would be half an hour before I would
 get his reaction to my report. I dozed off—and awoke with a start.
 Kayle was talking.


 ""—your report. I won't mince words. They're wondering at your role in
 the disaster. How does it happen that you alone survived?""


 ""How the hell do I know?"" I yelled—or croaked. But Kayle's voice was
 droning on:


 ""... you Psychodynamics people have been telling me the Gool may
 have some kind of long-range telehypnotic ability that might make it
 possible for them to subvert a loyal man without his knowledge. You've
 told me yourself that you blacked out during the attack—and came to on
 the lifeboat, with no recollection of how you got there.


 ""This is war, Granthan. War against a vicious enemy who strike without
 warning and without mercy. You were sent out to investigate the
 possibility of—what's that term you use?—hyper-cortical invasion. You
 know better than most the risk I'd be running if you were allowed to
 pass the patrol line.


 ""I'm sorry, Granthan. I can't let you land on Earth. I can't accept
 the risk.""


 ""What do I do now?"" I stormed. ""Go into orbit and eat pills and hope
 you think of something? I need a doctor!""


 Presently Kayle replied. ""Yes,"" he said. ""You'll have to enter a
 parking orbit. Perhaps there will be developments soon which will make
 it possible to ... ah ... restudy the situation."" He didn't meet my
 eye. I knew what he was thinking. He'd spare me the mental anguish of
 knowing what was coming. I couldn't really blame him; he was doing
 what he thought was the right thing. And I'd have to go along and
 pretend—right up until the warheads struck—that I didn't know I'd
 been condemned to death.
II


 I tried to gather my wits and think my way through the situation. I
 was alone and injured, aboard a lifeboat that would be the focus of a
 converging flight of missiles as soon as I approached within battery
 range of Earth. I had gotten clear of the Gool, but I wouldn't survive
 my next meeting with my own kind. They couldn't take the chance that I
 was acting under Gool orders.


 I wasn't, of course. I was still the same Peter Granthan,
 psychodynamicist, who had started out with Dayan's fleet six weeks
 earlier. The thoughts I was having weren't brilliant, but they were
 mine, all mine....


 But how could I be sure of that?


 Maybe there was something in Kayle's suspicion. If the Gool were as
 skillful as we thought, they would have left no overt indications of
 their tampering—not at a conscious level.


 But this was where psychodynamics training came in. I had been reacting
 like any scared casualty, aching to get home and lick his wounds. But I
 wasn't just any casualty. I had been trained in the subtleties of the
 mind—and I had been prepared for just such an attack.


 Now was the time to make use of that training. It had given me one
 resource. I could unlock the memories of my subconscious—and see again
 what had happened.


 I lay back, cleared my mind of extraneous thoughts, and concentrated on
 the trigger word that would key an auto-hypnotic sequence....


 Sense impressions faded. I was alone in the nebulous emptiness of a
 first-level trance. I keyed a second word, slipped below the misty
 surface into a dreamworld of vague phantasmagoric figures milling in
 their limbo of sub-conceptualization. I penetrated deeper, broke
 through into the vividly hallucinatory third level, where images of
 mirror-bright immediacy clamored for attention. And deeper....
The immense orderly confusion of the basic memory level lay before
 me. Abstracted from it, aloof and observant, the monitoring
 personality-fraction scanned the pattern, searching the polydimensional
 continuum for evidence of an alien intrusion.


 And found it.


 As the eye instantaneously detects a flicker of motion amid an infinity
 of static detail, so my inner eye perceived the subtle traces of the
 probing Gool mind, like a whispered touch deftly rearranging my buried
 motivations.


 I focused selectively, tuned to the recorded gestalt.


 ""
It is a contact, Effulgent One!
""


 ""
Softly, now! Nurture the spark well. It but trembles at the
 threshold....
""


 ""
It is elusive, Master! It wriggles like a gorm-worm in the eating
 trough!
""


 A part of my mind watched as the memory unreeled. I listened to the
 voices—yet not voices, merely the shape of concepts, indescribably
 intricate. I saw how the decoy pseudo-personality which I had
 concretized for the purpose in a hundred training sessions had fought
 against the intruding stimuli—then yielded under the relentless thrust
 of the alien probe. I watched as the Gool operator took over the motor
 centers, caused me to crawl through the choking smoke of the devastated
 control compartment toward the escape hatch. Fire leaped up, blocking
 the way. I went on, felt ghostly flames whipping at me—and then the
 hatch was open and I pulled myself through, forcing the broken leg.
 My blackened hand fumbled at the locking wheel. Then the blast as
 the lifeboat leaped clear of the disintegrating dreadnought—and the
 world-ending impact as I fell.


 At a level far below the conscious, the embattled pseudo-personality
 lashed out again—fighting the invader.


 ""
Almost it eluded me then, Effulgent Lord. Link with this lowly one!
""


 ""
Impossible! Do you forget all my teachings? Cling, though you expend
 the last filament of your life-force!
""


 Free from all distraction, at a level where comprehension and retention
 are instantaneous and total, my monitoring basic personality fraction
 followed the skillful Gool mind as it engraved its commands deep in
 my subconscious. Then the touch withdrew, erasing the scars of its
 passage, to leave me unaware of its tampering—at a conscious level.


 Watching the Gool mind, I learned.


 The insinuating probe—a concept regarding which psychodynamicists had
 theorized—was no more than a pattern in emptiness....


 But a pattern which I could duplicate, now that I had seen what had
 been done to me.


 Hesitantly, I felt for the immaterial fabric of the continuum, warping
 and manipulating it, copying the Gool probe. Like planes of paper-thin
 crystal, the polyfinite aspects of reality shifted into focus, aligning
 themselves.


 Abruptly, a channel lay open. As easily as I would stretch out my hand
 to pluck a moth from a night-flower, I reached across the unimaginable
 void—and sensed a pit blacker than the bottom floor of hell, and a
 glistening dark shape.


 There was a soundless shriek. ""
Effulgence! It reached out—touched
 me!
""
Using the technique I had grasped from the Gool itself, I struck,
 stifling the outcry, invaded the fetid blackness and grappled the
 obscene gelatinous immensity of the Gool spy as it spasmed in a frenzy
 of xenophobia—a ton of liver writhing at the bottom of a dark well.


 I clamped down control. The Gool mind folded in on itself, gibbering.
 Not pausing to rest, I followed up, probed along my channel of contact,
 tracing patterns, scanning the flaccid Gool mind....


 I saw a world of yellow seas lapping at endless shores of mud. There
 was a fuming pit, where liquid sulphur bubbled up from some inner
 source, filling an immense natural basin. The Gool clustered at its
 rim, feeding, each monstrous shape heaving against its neighbors for a
 more favorable position.
I probed farther, saw the great cables of living nervous tissue that
 linked each eating organ with the brain-mass far underground. I traced
 the passages through which tendrils ran out to immense caverns where
 smaller creatures labored over strange devices. These, my host's memory
 told me, were the young of the Gool. Here they built the fleets that
 would transport the spawn to the new worlds the Prime Overlord had
 discovered, worlds where food was free for the taking. Not sulphur
 alone, but potassium, calcium, iron and all the metals—riches
 beyond belief in endless profusion. No longer would the Gool tribe
 cluster—those who remained of a once-great race—at a single feeding
 trough. They would spread out across a galaxy—and beyond.


 But not if I could help it.


 The Gool had evolved a plan—but they'd had a stroke of bad luck.


 In the past, they had managed to control a man here and there, among
 the fleets, far from home, but only at a superficial level. Enough,
 perhaps, to wreck a ship, but not the complete control needed to send a
 man back to Earth under Gool compulsion, to carry out complex sabotage.


 Then they had found me, alone, a sole survivor, free from the clutter
 of the other mind-fields. It had been their misfortune to pick a
 psychodynamicist. Instead of gaining a patient slave, they had opened
 the fortress door to an unseen spy. Now that I was there, I would see
 what I could steal.


 A timeless time passed. I wandered among patterns of white light and
 white sound, plumbed the deepest recesses of hidden Gool thoughts,
 fared along strange ways examining the shapes and colors of the
 concepts of an alien mind.


 I paused at last, scanning a multi-ordinal structure of pattern within
 pattern; the diagrammed circuits of a strange machine.


 I followed through its logic-sequence; and, like a bomb-burst, its
 meaning exploded in my mind.


 From the vile nest deep under the dark surface of the Gool world in
 its lonely trans-Plutonian orbit, I had plucked the ultimate secret of
 their kind.


 Matter across space.
""You've got to listen to me, Kayle,"" I shouted. ""I know you think I'm
 a Gool robot. But what I have is too big to let you blow it up without
 a fight. Matter transmission! You know what that can mean to us. The
 concept is too complex to try to describe in words. You'll have to take
 my word for it. I can build it, though, using standard components, plus
 an infinite-area antenna and a moebius-wound coil—and a few other
 things....""


 I harangued Kayle for a while, and then sweated out his answer. I was
 getting close now. If he couldn't see the beauty of my proposal, my
 screens would start to register the radiation of warheads any time now.


 Kayle came back—and his answer boiled down to ""no.""


 I tried to reason with him. I reminded him how I had readied myself
 for the trip with sessions on the encephaloscope, setting up the
 cross-networks of conditioned defensive responses, the shunt circuits
 to the decoy pseudo-personality, leaving my volitional ego free. I
 talked about subliminal hypnotics and the resilience quotient of the
 ego-complex.


 I might have saved my breath.


 ""I don't understand that psychodynamics jargon, Granthan,"" he snapped.
 ""It smacks of mysticism. But I understand what the Gool have done to
 you well enough. I'm sorry.""


 I leaned back and chewed the inside of my lip and thought unkind
 thoughts about Colonel Ausar Kayle. Then I settled down to solve the
 problem at hand.


 I keyed the chart file, flashed pages from the standard index on the
 reference screen, checking radar coverages, beacon ranges, monitor
 stations, controller fields. It looked as though a radar-negative boat
 the size of mine might possibly get through the defensive net with a
 daring pilot, and as a condemned spy, I could afford to be daring.


 And I had a few ideas.
III


 The shrilling of the proximity alarm blasted through the silence. For a
 wild moment I thought Kayle had beaten me to the punch; then I realized
 it was the routine DEW line patrol contact.


 ""Z four-oh-two, I am reading your IFF. Decelerate at 1.8 gee
 preparatory to picking up approach orbit....""


 The screen went on droning out instructions. I fed them into the
 autopilot, at the same time running over my approach plan. The scout
 was moving in closer. I licked dry lips. It was time to try.


 I closed my eyes, reached out—as the Gool mind had reached out to
 me—and felt the touch of a Signals Officer's mind, forty thousand
 miles distant, aboard the patrol vessel. There was a brief flurry of
 struggle; then I dictated my instructions. The Signals Officer punched
 keys, spoke into his microphone:


 ""As you were, Z four-oh-two. Continue on present course. At Oh-nineteen
 seconds, pick up planetary for re-entry and let-down.""


 I blanked out the man's recollection of what had happened, caught his
 belated puzzlement as I broke contact. But I was clear of the DEW line
 now, rapidly approaching atmosphere.


 ""Z four-oh-two,"" the speaker crackled. ""This is planetary control. I am
 picking you up on channel forty-three, for re-entry and let-down.""


 There was a long pause. Then:


 ""Z four-oh-two, countermand DEW Line clearance! Repeat, clearance
 countermanded! Emergency course change to standard hyperbolic code
 ninety-eight. Do not attempt re-entry. Repeat: do not attempt re-entry!""


 It hadn't taken Kayle long to see that I'd gotten past the outer line
 of defense. A few more minutes' grace would have helped. I'd play it
 dumb, and hope for a little luck.


 ""Planetary, Z four-oh-two here. Say, I'm afraid I missed part of that,
 fellows. I'm a little banged up—I guess I switched frequencies on you.
 What was that after 'pick up channel forty-three'...?""


 ""Four-oh-two, sheer off there! You're not cleared for re-entry!""


 ""Hey, you birds are mixed up,"" I protested. ""I'm cleared all the way. I
 checked in with DEW—""


 It was time to disappear. I blanked off all transmission, hit the
 controls, following my evasive pattern. And again I reached out—


 A radar man at a site in the Pacific, fifteen thousand miles away, rose
 from his chair, crossed the darkened room and threw a switch. The radar
 screens blanked off....


 For an hour I rode the long orbit down, fending off attack after
 attack. Then I was clear, skimming the surface of the ocean a few miles
 southeast of Key West. The boat hit hard. I felt the floor rise up,
 over, buffeting me against the restraining harness.


 I hauled at the release lever, felt a long moment of giddy
 disorientation as the escape capsule separated from the sinking
 lifeboat deep under the surface. Then my escape capsule was bobbing on
 the water.


 I would have to risk calling Kayle now—but by voluntarily giving my
 position away, I should convince him I was still on our side—and I was
 badly in need of a pick-up. I flipped the sending key.


 ""This is Z four-oh-two,"" I said. ""I have an urgent report for Colonel
 Kayle of Aerospace Intelligence.""


 Kayle's face appeared. ""Don't fight it, Granthan,"" he croaked. ""You
 penetrated the planetary defenses—God knows how. I—""


 ""Later,"" I snapped. ""How about calling off your dogs now? And send
 somebody out here to pick me up, before I add sea-sickness to my other
 complaints.""


 ""We have you pinpointed,"" Kayle cut in. ""It's no use fighting it,
 Granthan.""
I felt cold sweat pop out on my forehead. ""You've got to listen,
 Kayle,"" I shouted. ""I suppose you've got missiles on the way already.
 Call them back! I have information that can win the war—""


 ""I'm sorry, Granthan,"" Kayle said. ""It's too late—even if I could
 take the chance you were right.""


 A different face appeared on the screen.


 ""Mr. Granthan, I am General Titus. On behalf of your country, and
 in the name of the President—who has been apprised of this tragic
 situation—it is my privilege to inform you that you will be awarded
 the Congressional Medal of Honor—posthumously—for your heroic effort.
 Although you failed, and have in fact been forced, against your will,
 to carry out the schemes of the inhuman enemy, this in no way detracts
 from your gallant attempt. Mr. Granthan, I salute you.""


 The general's arm went up in a rigid gesture.


 ""Stow that, you pompous idiot!"" I barked. ""I'm no spy!""


 Kayle was back, blanking out the startled face of the general.


 ""Goodbye, Granthan. Try to understand....""


 I flipped the switch, sat gripping the couch, my stomach rising with
 each heave of the floating escape capsule. I had perhaps five minutes.
 The missiles would be from Canaveral.


 I closed my eyes, forced myself to relax, reached out....


 I sensed the distant shore, the hot buzz of human minds at work in the
 cities. I followed the coastline, found the Missile Base, flicked
 through the cluster of minds.


 ""—
missile on course; do right, baby. That's it, right in the slot.
""


 I fingered my way through the man's mind and found the control centers.
 He turned stiffly from the plotting board, tottered to a panel to slam
 his hand against the destruct button.


 Men fell on him, dragged him back. ""—
fool, why did you blow it?
""


 I dropped the contact, found another, who leaped to the panel,
 detonated the remainder of the flight of six missiles. Then I withdrew.
 I would have a few minutes' stay of execution now.


 I was ten miles from shore. The capsule had its own power plant. I
 started it up, switched on the external viewer. I saw dark sea, the
 glint of star-light on the choppy surface, in the distance a glow on
 the horizon that would be Key West. I plugged the course into the
 pilot, then leaned back and felt outward with my mind for the next
 attacker.
IV


 It was dark in the trainyard. I moved along the tracks in a stumbling
 walk. Just a few more minutes, I was telling myself.
A few more
 minutes and you can lie down ... rest....
The shadowed bulk of a box car loomed up, its open door a blacker
 square. I leaned against the sill, breathing hard, then reached inside
 for a grip with my good hand.


 Gravel scrunched nearby. The beam of a flashlight lanced out, slipped
 along the weathered car, caught me. There was a startled exclamation.
 I ducked back, closed my eyes, felt out for his mind. There was a
 confused murmur of thought, a random intrusion of impressions from the
 city all around. It was hard, too hard. I had to sleep—


 I heard the snick of a revolver being cocked, and dropped flat as a
 gout of flame stabbed toward me, the imperative Bam! echoing between
 the cars. I caught the clear thought:


 ""God-awful looking, shaved head, arm stuck out; him all right—""


 I reached out to his mind and struck at random. The light fell, went
 out, and I heard the unconscious body slam to the ground like a poled
 steer.


 It was easy—if I could only stay awake.


 I gritted my teeth, pulled myself into the car, crawled to a dark
 corner behind a crate and slumped down. I tried to evoke a personality
 fraction to set as a guard, a part of my mind to stay awake and warn
 me of danger. It was too much trouble. I relaxed and let it all slide
 down into darkness.
The car swayed, click-clack, click-clack. I opened my eyes, saw yellow
 sunlight in a bar across the litter on the floor. The power truss
 creaked, pulling at my arm. My broken leg was throbbing its indignation
 at the treatment it had received—walking brace and all—and the burned
 arm was yelling aloud for more of that nice dope that had been keeping
 it from realizing how bad it was. All things considered, I felt like a
 badly embalmed mummy—except that I was hungry. I had been a fool not
 to fill my pockets when I left the escape capsule in the shallows off
 Key Largo, but things had been happening too fast.


 I had barely made it to the fishing boat, whose owner I had coerced
 into rendezvousing with me before shells started dropping around us. If
 the gunners on the cruiser ten miles away had had any luck, they would
 have finished me—and the hapless fisherman—right then. We rode out a
 couple of near misses, before I put the cruiser's gunnery crew off the
 air.


 At a fishing camp on the beach, I found a car—with driver. He dropped
 me at the railyard, and drove off under the impression he was in town
 for groceries. He'd never believe he'd seen me.


 Now I'd had my sleep. I had to start getting ready for the next act of
 the farce.


 I pressed the release on the power truss, gingerly unclamped it, then
 rigged a sling from a strip of shirt tail. I tied the arm to my side as
 inconspicuously as possible. I didn't disturb the bandages.


 I needed new clothes—or at least different ones—and something to
 cover my shaved skull. I couldn't stay hidden forever. The yard cop had
 recognized me at a glance.


 I lay back, waiting for the train to slow for a town. I wasn't unduly
 worried—at the moment. The watchman probably hadn't convinced anyone
 he'd actually seen me. Maybe he hadn't been too sure himself.


 The click-clack slowed and the train shuddered to a stop. I crept to
 the door, peered through the crack. There were sunny fields, a few low
 buildings in the distance, the corner of a platform. I closed my eyes
 and let my awareness stretch out.


 ""—
lousy job. What's the use? Little witch in the lunch room ... up in
 the hills, squirrel hunting, bottle of whiskey....
""


 I settled into control gently, trying not to alarm the man. I saw
 through his eyes the dusty box car, the rust on the tracks, the
 listless weeds growing among cinders, and the weathered boards of
 the platform. I turned him, and saw the dingy glass of the telegraph
 window, a sagging screen door with a chipped enameled cola sign.


 I walked the man to the door, and through it. Behind a linoleum-topped
 counter, a coarse-skinned teen-age girl with heavy breasts and wet
 patches under her arms looked up without interest as the door banged.


 My host went on to the counter, gestured toward the waxed-paper-wrapped
 sandwiches under a glass cover. ""I'll take 'em all. And candy bars, and
 cigarettes. And give me a big glass of water.""


 ""Better git out there and look after yer train,"" the girl said
 carelessly. ""When'd you git so all-fired hungry all of a sudden?""


 ""Put it in a bag. Quick.""


 ""Look who's getting bossy—""


 My host rounded the counter, picked up a used paper bag, began stuffing
 food in it. The girl stared at him, then pushed him back. ""You git back
 around that counter!""


 She filled the bag, took a pencil from behind her ear.


 ""That'll be one eighty-five. Cash.""


 My host took two dog-eared bills from his shirt pocket, dropped them
 on the counter and waited while the girl filled a glass. He picked it
 up and started out.


 ""Hey! Where you goin' with my glass?""


 The trainman crossed the platform, headed for the boxcar. He slid the
 loose door back a few inches against the slack latch, pushed the bag
 inside, placed the glass of water beside it, then pulled off his grimy
 railroader's cap and pushed it through the opening. He turned. The girl
 watched from the platform. A rattle passed down the line and the train
 started up with a lurch. The man walked back toward the girl. I heard
 him say: ""Friend o' mine in there—just passin' through.""


 I was discovering that it wasn't necessary to hold tight control over
 every move of a subject. Once given the impulse to act, he would
 rationalize his behavior, fill in the details—and never know that the
 original idea hadn't been his own.


 I drank the water first, ate a sandwich, then lit a cigarette and lay
 back. So far so good. The crates in the car were marked ""U. S. Naval
 Aerospace Station, Bayou Le Cochon"". With any luck I'd reach New
 Orleans in another twelve hours. The first step of my plan included a
 raid on the Delta National Labs; but that was tomorrow. That could
 wait.
It was a little before dawn when I crawled out of the car at a siding
 in the swampy country a few miles out of New Orleans. I wasn't feeling
 good, but I had a stake in staying on my feet. I still had a few miles
 in me. I had my supplies—a few candy bars and some cigarettes—stuffed
 in the pockets of the tattered issue coverall. Otherwise, I was
 unencumbered. Unless you wanted to count the walking brace on my right
 leg and the sling binding my arm.


 I picked my way across mushy ground to a pot-holed black-top road,
 started limping toward a few car lights visible half a mile away. It
 was already hot. The swamp air was like warmed-over subway fumes.
 Through the drugs, I could feel my pulse throbbing in my various
 wounds. I reached out and touched the driver's mind; he was thinking
 about shrimps, a fish-hook wound on his left thumb and a girl with
 black hair. ""Want a lift?"" he called.


 I thanked him and got in. He gave me a glance and I pinched off his
 budding twinge of curiosity. It was almost an effort now not to follow
 his thoughts. It was as though my mind, having learned the trick of
 communications with others, instinctively reached out toward them.


 An hour later he dropped me on a street corner in a shabby marketing
 district of the city and drove off. I hoped he made out all right with
 the dark-haired girl. I spotted a used-clothing store and headed for it.


 Twenty minutes later I was back on the sidewalk, dressed in a
 pinkish-gray suit that had been cut a long time ago by a Latin
 tailor—maybe to settle a grudge. The shirt that went with it was
 an unsuccessful violet. The black string tie lent a dubious air of
 distinction. I'd swapped the railroader's cap for a tarnished beret.
 The man who had supplied the outfit was still asleep. I figured
 I'd done him a favor by taking it. I couldn't hope to pass for a
 fisherman—I wasn't the type. Maybe I'd get by as a coffee-house
 derelict.


 I walked past fly-covered fish stalls, racks of faded garments, grimy
 vegetables in bins, enough paint-flaked wrought iron to cage a herd of
 brontosauri, and fetched up at a cab stand. I picked a fat driver with
 a wart.


 ""How much to the Delta National Laboratories?""


 He rolled an eye toward me, shifted his toothpick.


 ""What ya wanna go out there for? Nothing out there.""


 ""I'm a tourist,"" I said. ""They told me before I left home not to miss
 it.""


 He grunted, reached back and opened the door. I got in. He flipped his
 flag down, started up with a clash of gears and pulled out without
 looking.


 ""How far is it?"" I asked him.


 ""It ain't far. Mile, mile and a quarter.""


 ""Pretty big place, I guess.""


 He didn't answer.


 We went through a warehousing district, swung left along the
 waterfront, bumped over railroad tracks, and pulled up at a nine-foot
 cyclone fence with a locked gate.


 ""A buck ten,"" my driver said.


 I looked out at the fence, a barren field, a distant group of low
 buildings. ""What's this?""


 ""This is the place you ast for. That'll be a buck ten, mister.""


 I touched his mind, planted a couple of false impressions and withdrew.
 He blinked, then started up, drove around the field, pulled up at an
 open gate with a blue-uniformed guard. He looked back at me.


 ""You want I should drive in, sir?""


 ""I'll get out here.""


 He jumped out, opened my door, helped me out with a hand under my good
 elbow. ""I'll get your change, sir,"" he said, reaching for his hip.


 ""Keep it.""


 ""Thank YOU."" He hesitated. ""Maybe I oughta stick around. You know.""


 ""I'll be all right.""


 ""I hope so,"" he said. ""A man like you—you and me—"" he winked. ""After
 all, we ain't both wearing berets fer nothing.""


 ""True,"" I said. ""Consider your tip doubled. Now drive away into the
 sunrise and forget you ever saw me.""

BY JIM HARMON
One little village couldn't have

 a monopoly on all the bad breaks

 in the world. They did, though!

They say automation makes jobs, especially if ""they"" are trying to keep
 their own job of selling automation machines. I know the Actuarvac made
 one purple passion of a job for me, the unpleasantly fatal results of
 which are still lingering with me.


 Thad McCain, my boss at Manhattan-Universal Insurance, beamed over
 the sprawling automatic brain's silver gauges and plastic toggles as
 proudly as if he had just personally gave birth to it. ""This will
 simplify your job to the point of a pleasant diversion, Madison.""


 ""Are you going to keep paying me for staying with my little hobby?"" I
 asked, suspiciously eyeing my chrome competitor.


 ""The Actuarvac poses no threat to your career. It will merely keep you
 from flying off on wild-goose chases. It will unvaryingly separate from
 the vast body of legitimate claims the phony ones they try to spike us
 for. Then all that remains is for you to gather the accessory details,
 the evidence to jail our erring customers.""


 ""Fine,"" I said. I didn't bother to inform him that that was all my job
 had ever been.


 McCain shuffled his cards. They were cards for the machine, listing new
 individual claims on company policies. Since the two-month-old machine
 was literate and could read typewriting, the cards weren't coded or
 punched. He read the top one. ""Now this, for instance. No adjuster
 need investigate this accident. The circumstances obviously are such
 that no false claim could be filed. Of course, the brain will make
 an unfailing analysis of all the factors involved and clear the claim
 automatically and officially.""


 McCain threaded the single card into the slot for an example to me.
 He then flicked the switch and we stood there watching the monster
 ruminate thoughtfully. It finally rang a bell and spit the card back at
 Manhattan-Universal's top junior vice-president.


 He took it like a man.


 ""That's what the machine is for,"" he said philosophically. ""To detect
 human error. Hmm. What kind of a shove do you get out of this?""


 He handed me the rejected claim card. I took it, finding a new, neatly
 typed notation on it. It said:


 Investigate the Ozark village of Granite City.


 ""You want me to project it in a movie theater and see how it stands it
 all alone in the dark?"" I asked.


 ""Just circle up the wagon train and see how the Indians fall,"" McCain
 said anxiously.


 ""It's too general. What does the nickel-brained machine mean by
 investigating a whole town? I don't know if it has crooked politics,
 a polygamy colony or a hideout for supposedly deported gangsters. I
 don't care much either. It's not my business. How could a whole town be
 filing false life and accident claims?""


 ""Find that out,"" he said. ""I trust the machine. There have been cases
 of mass collusion before. Until you get back, we are making no more
 settlements with that settlement.""
Research. To a writer that generally means legally permissible
 plagiarism. For an insurance adjuster, it means earnest work.


 Before I headed for the hills, or the Ozark Mountains, I walked a few
 hundred feet down the hall and into the manual record files. The brain
 abstracted from empirical data but before I planed out to Granite City
 I had to find the basis for a few practical, nasty suspicions.


 Four hours of flipping switches and looking at microfilm projections
 while a tawny redhead in a triangular fronted uniform carried me reels
 to order gave me only two ideas. Neither was very original. The one
 that concerned business was that the whole village of Granite City must
 be accident-prone.


 I rejected that one almost immediately. While an accident-prone was
 in himself a statistical anomaly, the idea of a whole town of them
 gathered together stretched the fabric of reality to the point where
 even an invisible re-weaver couldn't help it.


 There was an explanation for the recent rise in the accident rate down
 there. The rock quarry there had gone into high-level operation. I
 knew why from the floor, walls, ceiling border, table trimmings in the
 records room. They were all granite. The boom in granite for interior
 and exterior decoration eclipsed earlier periods of oak, plastics,
 wrought iron and baked clay completely. The distinctive grade of
 granite from Granite City was being put into use all over the planet
 and in the Officer's Clubs on the Moon and Mars.


 Yet the rise in accident, compared to the rise in production, was out
 of all proportion.


 Furthermore, the work at the quarry could hardly explain the excessive
 accident reports we had had from the village as far back as our records
 went.


 We had paid off on most of the claims since they seemed irrefutably
 genuine. All were complete with eye-witness reports and authenticated
 circumstances.


 There was one odd note in the melodic scheme: We had never had a claim
 for any kind of automobile accident from Granite City.


 I shut off the projector.


 It may be best to keep an open mind, but I have found in practice that
 you have to have some kind of working theory which you must proceed to
 prove is either right or wrong.


 Tentatively, I decided that for generations the citizens of
 Granite City had been in an organized conspiracy to defraud
 Manhattan-Universal and its predecessors of hundreds upon hundreds of
 thousands of dollars in false accident claims.


 Maybe they made their whole livelihood off us before the quarry opened
 up.


 I used my pocket innercom and had my secretary get me a plane
 reservation and a gun.


 After so many profitable decades, Granite City wasn't going to take
 kindly to my spoil-sport interference.
The Absinthe Flight to Springfield was jolly and relatively fast.
 Despite headwinds we managed Mach 1.6 most of the way. My particular
 stewardess was a blonde, majoring in Video Psychotherapy in her night
 courses. I didn't have much time to get acquainted or more than hear
 the outline of her thesis on the guilt purgings effected by The Life
 and Legend of Gary Cooper. The paunchy businessman in the next lounge
 was already nibbling the ear of his red-haired hostess. He was the
 type of razorback who took the girls for granted and aimed to get his
 money's worth. I gave Helen, the blonde, a kiss on the cheek and began
 flipping through the facsimiles in my briefcase as we chute-braked for
 a landing at the Greater Ozarks.


 It took me a full five minutes to find out that I couldn't take a
 copter to Granite City. Something about downdrafts in the mountains.


 Since that put me back in the days of horsepower, I trotted over to the
 automobile rental and hired a few hundred of them under the hood of a
 Rolls. That was about the only brand of car that fit me. I hadn't been
 able to get my legs into any other foreign car since I was fifteen,
 and I have steadfastly refused to enter an American model since they
 all sold out their birthrights as passenger cars and went over to the
 tractor-trailer combinations they used only for cargo trucks when I was
 a boy. Dragging around thirty feet of car is sheer nonsense, even for
 prestige.


 It was a tiresome fifty-mile drive, on manual all the way after I left
 the radar-channel area of the city. Up and down, slowing for curves,
 flipping into second for the hills.


 The whole trip hardly seemed worth it when I saw the cluster of
 painted frame buildings that was Granite City. They looked like a
 tumble of dingy building blocks tossed in front of a rolled-up indigo
 sports shirt. That was Granite Mountain in the near foreground. But I
 remembered that over the course of some forty years the people in these
 few little stacks of lumber had taken Manhattan-Universal for three
 quarters of a megabuck.


 I turned off onto the gravel road, spraying my fenders with a hail of
 a racket. Then I stepped down hard on my brakes, bracing myself to keep
 from going through the windscreen. I had almost sideswiped an old man
 sitting at the side of the road, huddled in his dusty rags.


 ""Are you okay?"" I yelled, thumbing down the window.


 ""I've suffered no harm at your hands—or your wheels, sir. But I could
 use some help,"" the old man said. ""Could I trouble you for a lift when
 you leave town?""


 I wasn't too sure about that. Most of these guys who are on the hobo
 circuit talking like they owned some letters to their names besides
 their initials belonged to some cult or other. I try to be as tolerant
 as I can, and some of my best friends are thugs, but I don't want to
 drive with them down lonely mountain roads.


 ""We'll see what we can work out,"" I said. ""Right now can you tell me
 where I can find Marshal Thompson?""


 ""I can,"" he said. ""But you will have to walk there.""


 ""Okay. It shouldn't be much of a walk in Granite City.""


 ""It's the house at the end of the street.""


 ""It is,"" I said. ""Why shouldn't I drive up there? The street's open.""


 The old man stared at me with red-shot eyes. ""Marshal Thompson doesn't
 like people to run automobiles on the streets of Granite City.""


 ""So I'll just
lock
the car up and walk over there. I couldn't go
 getting tire tracks all over your clean streets.""


 The old man watched as I climbed down and locked up the Rolls.


 ""You would probably get killed if you did run the car here, you know,""
 he said conversationally.


 ""Well,"" I said, ""I'll be getting along."" I tried to walk sideways so I
 could keep an eye on him.


 ""Come back,"" he said, as if he had doubts.
The signs of a menacing conspiracy were growing stronger, I felt. I
 had my automatic inside my shirt, but I decided I might need a less
 lethal means of expression. Without breaking stride, I scooped up a
 baseball-size hunk of bluish rock from the road and slipped it into my
 small change pocket.


 I have made smarter moves in my time.
As I approached the house at the end of the lane, I saw it was about
 the worse construction job I had seen in my life. It looked as
 architecturally secure as a four-year-old's drawing of his home. The
 angles were measurably out of line. Around every nail head were two
 nails bent out of shape and hammered down, and a couple of dozen welts
 in the siding where the hammer had missed any nail. The paint job was
 spotty and streaked. Half the panes in the windows were cracked. I
 fought down the dust in my nose, afraid of the consequences of a sneeze
 to the place.


 My toe scuffed the top porch step and I nearly crashed face first into
 the front door. I had been too busy looking at the house, I decided. I
 knocked.


 Moments later, the door opened.


 The lean-faced man who greeted me had his cheeks crisscrossed with
 razor nicks and his shirt on wrong side out. But his eyes were bright
 and sparrow alert.


 ""Are you Mr. Marshal Thompson, the agent for Manhattan-Universal
 Insurance?"" I put to him.


 ""I'm
the
marshal, name of Thompson. But you ain't the first to take
 my title for my Christian name. You from the company?""


 ""Yes,"" I said. ""Were you expecting me?""


 Thompson nodded. ""For forty-one years.""
Thompson served the coffee in the chipped cups, favoring only slightly
 his burned fingers.


 Catching the direction of my glance, he said, ""Company is worth a few
 scalds, Mr. Madison.""


 I accepted the steaming cup and somehow it very nearly slipped out of
 my hands. I made a last microsecond retrieve.


 The marshal nodded thoughtfully. ""You're new here.""


 ""First time,"" I said, sipping coffee. It was awful. He must have made a
 mistake and put salt into it instead of sugar.


 ""You think the claims I've been filing for my people are false?""


 ""The home office has some suspicions of that,"" I admitted.


 ""I don't blame them, but they ain't. Look, the company gambles on luck,
 doesn't it?""


 ""No. It works on percentages calculated from past experience.""


 ""But I mean it knows that there will be, say, a hundred fatal car
 crashes in a day. But it doesn't know if maybe ninety of them will be
 in Iowa and only ten in the rest of the country.""


 ""There's something to that. We call it probability, not luck.""


 ""Well, probability says that more accidents are going to occur in
 Granite City than anywhere else in the country, per capita.""


 I shook my head at Thompson. ""That's not probability. Theoretically,
 anything can happen but I don't—I can't—believe that in this town
 everybody has chanced to be an accident prone. Some other factor is
 operating. You are all deliberately faking these falls and fires—""


 ""We're not,"" Thompson snapped.


 ""Or else something is causing you to have this trouble. Maybe the
 whole town is a bunch of dope addicts. Maybe you grow your own mescalin
 or marijuana; it's happened before.""


 Thompson laughed.


 ""Whatever is going on, I'm going to find it out. I don't care what you
 do, but if I can find a greater risk here and prove it, the Commission
 will let us up our rates for this town. Probably beyond the capacity of
 these people, I'm afraid.""


 ""That would be a real tragedy, Mr. Madison. Insurance is vital to this
 town. Nobody could survive a year here without insurance. People pay me
 for their premiums before they pay their grocery bills.""


 I shrugged, sorrier than I could let on. ""I won't be able to pay for
 my own groceries, marshal, if I don't do the kind of job the company
 expects. I'm going to snoop around.""


 ""All right,"" he said grudgingly, ""but you'll have to do it on foot.""


 ""Yes, I understood you didn't like cars on your streets. At least not
 the cars of outsiders.""


 ""That doesn't have anything to do with it. Nobody in Granite City owns
 a car. It would be suicide for anybody to drive a car, same as it would
 be to have a gas or oil stove, instead of coal, or to own a bathtub.""


 I took a deep breath.


 ""Showers,"" Thompson said. ""With nonskid mats and handrails.""


 I shook hands with him. ""You've been a great help.""


 ""Four o'clock,"" he said. ""Roads are treacherous at night.""


 ""There's always a dawn.""


 Thompson met my eyes. ""That's not quite how we look at it here.""
II


 The quarry was a mess.


 I couldn't see any in the way they sliced the granite out of the
 mountain. The idea of a four-year-old—a four-year-old moron—going
 after a mound of raspberry ice cream kept turning up in my mind as I
 walked around.


 The workmen were gone; it was after five local time. But here and
 there I saw traces of them. Some of them were sandwich wrappers and
 cigarette stubs, but most of the traces were smears of blood. Blood
 streaked across sharp rocks, blood oozing from beneath heavy rocks,
 blood smeared on the handles and working surfaces of sledge hammers and
 tools. The place was as gory as a battlefield.


 ""What are you looking for, bud?""


 The low, level snarl had come from a burly character in a syn-leather
 jacket and narrow-brimmed Stetson.


 ""The reason you have so many accidents here,"" I said frankly. ""I'm from
 the insurance company. Name's Madison.""


 ""Yeah, I know.""


 I had supposed he would.


 ""I'm Kelvin, the foreman here,"" the big man told me, extending a ham of
 a fist to be shook. ""Outside, doing my Army time, I noticed that most
 people don't have as many slipups as we do here. Never could figure it
 out.""


 ""This rock is part of it—""


 ""What do you mean by that!"" Kelvin demanded savagely.


 ""I mean the way you work it. No system to it. No stratification, no
 plateau work...""


 ""Listen, Madison, don't talk about what you don't know anything
 about. The stuff in these walls isn't just rock; it isn't even plain
 granite. Granite City exports some of the finest grade of the stone in
 the world. And it's used all over the world. We aren't just a bunch
 of meatheaded ditch diggers—we are craftsmen. We have to figure a
 different way of getting out every piece of stone.""


 ""It's too bad.""


 ""What's too bad?""


 ""That you chose the wrong way so often,"" I said.


 Kelvin breathed a virile grade of tobacco into my face. ""Listen,
 Madison, we have been working this quarry for generations, sometimes
 more of us working than other times. Today most of us are working
 getting the stone out. That's the way we like it. We don't want any
 outsider coming in and interfering with that.""


 ""If this quarry has anything to do with defrauding Manhattan-Universal,
 I can tell you that I will do something about that!""


 As soon as my teeth clicked back together, the sickening feeling hit me
 that I shouldn't have said that.
The general store was called a supermarket, but it wasn't particularly
 superior.


 I took a seat at the soda fountain and took a beer, politely declining
 the teen-age clerk's offer of a shot of white lightning from the
 Pepsi-Cola fountain syrup jug for a quarter.


 Behind me were three restaurant tables and one solitary red-upholstered
 booth. Two men somewhere between forty and sixty sat at the nearest
 table playing twenty-one.


 Over the foam of my stein I saw the old man I had almost run down in
 the road. He marched through the two-thirds of the building composed of
 rows of can goods and approached the fat man at the cash register.


 ""Hello, Professor,"" the fat man said. ""What can we do for you?""


 ""I'd like to mail a letter,"" he said in an urgent voice.


 ""Sure, Professor, I'll send it right off on the facsimile machine as
 soon as I get a free moment.""


 ""You're sure you can send it? Right away?""


 ""Positive. Ten cents, Professor.""


 The professor fumbled in his pants' pocket and fished out a dime. He
 fingered it thoughtfully.


 ""I suppose the letter can wait,"" he said resignedly. ""I believe I will
 buy a pair of doughnuts, Mr. Haskel.""


 ""Why not get a hamburger, Professor? Special sale today. Only a dime.
 And since you're such a good customer I'll throw in a cup of coffee and
 the two sinkers for nothing.""


 ""That's—kind of you,"" the old man said awkwardly.


 Haskel shrugged. ""A man has to eat.""


 The man called ""the professor"" came over and sat down two stools away,
 ignoring me. The clerk dialed his hamburger and served it.


 I stayed with my beer and my thoughts.


 More and more, I was coming to believe that Granite City wasn't a job
 for an investigative adjuster like myself but a psychological adjuster.
 Crime is a structural flaw in a community, yes. But when the whole
 society is criminal, distorted, you can't isolate the flaw. The whole
 village was meat for a sociologist; let him figure out why otherwise
 decent citizens felt secure in conspiracy to defraud an honored
 corporation.


 I didn't feel that I was licked or that the trip had been a failure.
 I had merely established to my intuitive satisfaction that the job was
 not in my field.


 I glanced at the old man. The proprietor of the store knew him and
 evidently thought him harmless enough to feed.


 ""I think I can make it down the mountain before dark, Old Timer,"" I
 called over to him. ""You can come along if you like.""


 The acne-faced kid behind the counter stared at me. I looked over and
 caught the bright little eyes of Haskel, the proprietor, too. Finally,
 the old professor turned on his stool, his face pale and his eyes sad
 and resigned.


 ""I doubt very much if either of us will be leaving, Mr. Madison,"" he
 said. ""Now.""
I took my beer and the professor his coffee over to the single booth.
 We looked at each other across the shiny table and our beverage
 containers.


 ""I am Doctor Arnold Parnell of Duke University,"" the professor said. ""I
 left on my sabbatical five months ago. I have been here ever since.""


 I looked at his clothes. ""You must not have been very well fixed for a
 year's vacation, Professor.""


 ""I,"" he said, ""have enough traveler's checks with me to paper a
 washroom. Nobody in this town will cash them for me.""


 ""I can understand why you want to go somewhere where people are more
 trusting in that case.""


 ""They know the checks are good. It's
me
they refuse to trust to leave
 this place. They think they
can't
let me go.""


 ""I don't see any shackles on you,"" I remarked.


 ""Just because you can't see them,"" he growled, ""doesn't mean they
 aren't there. Marshal Thompson has the only telephone in the village.
 He has politely refused to let me use it. I'm a suspicious and
 undesirable character; he's under no obligation to give me telephone
 privileges, he says. Haskel has the Post Office concession—the Telefax
 outfit behind the money box over there. He takes my letters but I never
 see him send them off. And I never get a reply.""


 ""Unfriendly of them,"" I said conservatively. ""But how can they stop you
 from packing your dental floss and cutting out?""


 ""Haskel has the only motor vehicle in town—a half-ton pick-up, a
 minuscule contrivance less than the size of a passenger car. He makes
 about one trip a week down into the city for supplies and package mail.
 He's been the only one in or out of Granite City for five months.""


 It seemed incredible—more than that, unlikely, to me. ""How about the
 granite itself? How do they ship it out?""


 ""It's an artificial demand product, like diamonds,"" Professor Parnell
 said. ""They stockpile it and once a year the executive offices for the
 company back in Nashville runs in a portable monorail railroad up the
 side of the mountain to take it out. That won't be for another four
 months, as nearly as I can find out. I may not last that long.""


 ""How are you living?"" I asked. ""If they won't take your checks—""


 ""I do odd jobs for people. They feed me, give me a little money
 sometimes.""


 ""I can see why you want to ride out with me,"" I said. ""Haven't you ever
 thought of just
walking
out?""


 ""Fifty miles down a steep mountain road? I'm an old man, Mr. Madison,
 and I've gotten even older since I came to Granite City.""


 I nodded. ""You have any papers, any identification, to back this up?""


 Wordlessly, he handed over his billfold, letters, enough identification
 to have satisfied Allen Pinkerton or John Edgar Hoover.


 ""Okay,"" I drawled. ""I'll accept your story for the moment. Now answer
 me the big query: Why are the good people of Granite City doing this to
 you? By any chance, you wouldn't happen to know of a mass fraud they
 are perpetrating on Manhattan-Universal?""


 ""I know nothing of their ethical standards,"" Parnell said, ""but I do
 know that they are absolutely
subhuman
!""


 ""I admit I have met likelier groups of human beings in my time.""


 ""No, understand me. These people are literally subhuman—they are
 inferior to other human beings.""


 ""Look, I know the Klan is a growing organization but I can't go along
 with you.""


 ""Madison, understand me, I insist. Ethnologically speaking, it is well
 known that certain tribes suffer certain deficiencies due to diet,
 climate, et cetera. Some can't run, sing, use mathematics. The people
 of Granite City have the most unusual deficency on record, I admit.
 Their
psionic
senses have been impaired. They are completely devoid
 of any use of telepathy, precognition, telekinesis.""
""Because they aren't supermen, that doesn't mean that they are submen,""
 I protested. ""I don't have any psionic abilities either.""


 ""But you do!"" Parnell said earnestly. ""Everybody has some psionics
 ability, but we don't realize it. We don't have the fabulous abilities
 of a few recorded cases of supermen, but we have some, a trace. Granite
 City citizens have
no
psionic ability whatsoever, not even the little
 that you and I and the rest of the world have!""


 ""You said you were Duke University, didn't you?"" I mused. ""Maybe you
 know what you are talking about; I've never been sure. But these
 people can't suffer very much from their lack of what you call psi
 ability.""


 ""I tell you they do,"" he said hoarsely. ""We never realize it but we all
 have some power of precognition. If we didn't, we would have a hundred
 accidents a day—just as these people
do
. They can't foresee the
 bump in the road the way we can, or that that particular match will
 flare a little higher and burn their fingers. There are other things,
 as well. You'll find it is almost impossible to carry on a lengthy
 conversation with any of them—they have no telepathic ability, no
 matter how slight, to see through the semantic barrier. None of them
 can play ball. They don't have the unconscious psionic ability to
 influence the ball in flight. All of us can do that, even if the case
 of a 'Poltergeist' who can lift objects is rare.""


 ""Professor, you mean these people are holding you here simply so you
 won't go out and tell the rest of the world that they are submen?""


 ""They don't want the world to know
why
they are psionically
 subnormal,"" he said crisply. ""It's the
granite
! I don't understand
 why myself. I'm not a physicist or a biologist. But for some reason the
 heavy concentration and particular pattern of the radioactive radiation
 in its matrix is responsible for both inhibiting the genes that
 transmit psi powers from generation to generation
and
affecting those
 abilities in the present generation. A kind of psionic sterility.""


 ""How do you know this?""


 ""We haven't the time for all that. But think about it. What else
could
it be? It's that granite that they are shipping all over the
 world, spreading the contamination. I want to stop that contamination.
 To the people of Granite City that means ruining their only industry,
 putting them all out of work. They are used to this psionic sterility;
 they don't see anything so bad about it. Besides, like everybody else,
 they have some doubts that there really are such things as telepathy
 and the rest to be affected.""


 ""Frankly,"" I said, hedging only a little, ""I don't know what to
 make of your story. This is something to be decided by somebody
 infallible—like the Pope or the President or Board Chairman of
 Manhattan-Universal. But the first thing to do is get you out of here.
 We had better get back to my car. I've got good lights to get down the
 mountain.""


 Parnell jumped up eagerly, and brushed over his china mug, staining the
 tabletop with brown caffeine.


 ""Sorry,"" he said. ""I should have been precognizant of that. I try to
 stay away from the rock as much as possible, but it's getting to me.""


 I should have remembered something then. But, naturally, I didn't.

to remember charlie by
by ... Roger Dee
Just a one-eyed dog named Charlie and a crippled boy named
 Joey—but between them they changed the face of the universe
 ... perhaps.
Inearly stumbled over the kid in the dark before I saw him.


 His wheelchair was parked as usual on the tired strip of carpet grass
 that separated his mother's trailer from the one Doc Shull and I lived
 in, but it wasn't exactly where I'd learned to expect it when I rolled
 in at night from the fishing boats. Usually it was nearer the west end
 of the strip where Joey could look across the crushed-shell square of
 the Twin Palms trailer court and the palmetto flats to the Tampa
 highway beyond. But this time it was pushed back into the shadows away
 from the court lights.


 The boy wasn't watching the flats tonight, as he usually did. Instead
 he was lying back in his chair with his face turned to the sky,
 staring upward with such absorbed intensity that he didn't even know I
 was there until I spoke.


 ""Anything wrong, Joey?"" I asked.


 He said, ""No, Roy,"" without taking his eyes off the sky.


 For a minute I had the prickly feeling you get when you are watching a
 movie and find that you know just what is going to happen next.
 You're puzzled and a little spooked until you realize that the reason
 you can predict the action so exactly is because you've seen the same
 thing happen somewhere else a long time ago. I forgot the feeling when
 I remembered why the kid wasn't watching the palmetto flats. But I
 couldn't help wondering why he'd turned to watching the sky instead.


 ""What're you looking for up there, Joey?"" I asked.


 He didn't move and from the tone of his voice I got the impression
 that he only half heard me.


 ""I'm moving some stars,"" he said softly.


 I gave it up and went on to my own trailer without asking any more
 fool questions. How can you talk to a kid like that?


 Doc Shull wasn't in, but for once I didn't worry about him. I was
 trying to remember just what it was about my stumbling over Joey's
 wheelchair that had given me that screwy double-exposure feeling of
 familiarity. I got a can of beer out of the ice-box because I think
 better with something cold in my hand, and by the time I had finished
 the beer I had my answer.


 The business I'd gone through with Joey outside was familiar because
 it
had
happened before, about six weeks back when Doc and I first
 parked our trailer at the Twin Palms court. I'd nearly stumbled over
 Joey that time too, but he wasn't moving stars then. He was just
 staring ahead of him, waiting.


 He'd been sitting in his wheelchair at the west end of the
 carpet-grass strip, staring out over the palmetto flats toward the
 highway. He was practically holding his breath, as if he was waiting
 for somebody special to show up, so absorbed in his watching that he
 didn't know I was there until I spoke. He reminded me a little of a
 ventriloquist's dummy with his skinny, knob-kneed body, thin face and
 round, still eyes. Only there wasn't anything comical about him the
 way there is about a dummy. Maybe that's why I spoke, because he
 looked so deadly serious.


 ""Anything wrong, kid?"" I asked.


 He didn't jump or look up. His voice placed him as a cracker, either
 south Georgian or native Floridian.


 ""I'm waiting for Charlie to come home,"" he said, keeping his eyes on
 the highway.


 Probably I'd have asked who Charlie was but just then the trailer door
 opened behind him and his mother took over.


 I couldn't see her too well because the lights were off inside the
 trailer. But I could tell from the way she filled up the doorway that
 she was big. I could make out the white blur of a cigarette in her
 mouth, and when she struck a match to light it—on her thumb-nail,
 like a man—I saw that she was fairly young and not bad-looking in a
 tough, sullen sort of way. The wind was blowing in my direction and it
 told me she'd had a drink recently, gin, by the smell of it.


 ""This is none of your business, mister,"" she said. Her voice was
 Southern like the boy's but with all the softness ground out of it
 from living on the Florida coast where you hear a hundred different
 accents every day. ""Let the boy alone.""


 She was right about it being none of my business. I went on into the
 trailer I shared with Doc Shull and left the two of them waiting for
 Charlie together.


 Our trailer was dark inside, which meant first that Doc had probably
 gone out looking for a drink as soon as I left that morning to pick up
 a job, and second that he'd probably got too tight to find his way
 back. But I was wrong on at least one count, because when I switched
 on the light and dumped the packages I'd brought on the sink cabinet I
 saw Doc asleep in his bunk.


 He'd had a drink, though. I could smell it on him when I shook him
 awake, and it smelled like gin.


 Doc sat up and blinked against the light, a thin, elderly little man
 with bright blue eyes, a clipped brown mustache and scanty brown hair
 tousled and wild from sleep. He was stripped to his shorts against the
 heat, but at some time during the day he had bathed and shaved. He had
 even washed and ironed a shirt; it hung on a nail over his bunk with a
 crumpled pack of cigarettes in the pocket.


 ""Crawl out and cook supper, Rip,"" I said, holding him to his end of
 our working agreement. ""I've made a day and I'm hungry.""


 Doc got up and stepped into his pants. He padded barefoot across the
 linoleum and poked at the packages on the sink cabinet.


 ""Snapper steak again,"" he complained. ""Roy, I'm sick of fish!""


 ""You don't catch sirloins with a hand-line,"" I told him. And because
 I'd never been able to stay sore at him for long I added, ""But we got
 beer. Where's the opener?""


 ""I'm sick of beer, too,"" Doc said. ""I need a real drink.""


 I sniffed the air, making a business of it. ""You've had one already.
 Where?""


 He grinned at me then with the wise-to-himself-and-the-world grin that
 lit up his face like turning on a light inside and made him different
 from anybody else on earth.


 ""The largess of Providence,"" he said, ""is bestowed impartially upon
 sot and Samaritan. I helped the little fellow next door to the
 bathroom this afternoon while his mother was away at work, and my
 selflessness had its just reward.""


 Sometimes it's hard to tell when Doc is kidding. He's an educated
 man—used to teach at some Northern college, he said once, and I never
 doubted it—and talks like one when he wants to. But Doc's no bum,
 though he's a semi-alcoholic and lets me support him like an invalid
 uncle, and he's keen enough to read my mind like a racing form.


 ""No, I didn't batter down the cupboard and help myself,"" he said. ""The
 lady—her name is Mrs. Ethel Pond—gave me the drink. Why else do you
 suppose I'd launder a shirt?""


 That was like Doc. He hadn't touched her bottle though his insides
 were probably snarled up like barbed wire for the want of it. He'd
 shaved and pressed a shirt instead so he'd look decent enough to rate
 a shot of gin she'd offer him as a reward. It wasn't such a doubtful
 gamble at that, because Doc has a way with him when he bothers to use
 it; maybe that's why he bums around with me after the commercial
 fishing and migratory crop work, because he's used that charm too
 often in the wrong places.


 ""Good enough,"" I said and punctured a can of beer apiece for us while
 Doc put the snapper steaks to cook.


 He told me more about our neighbors while we killed the beer. The
 Ponds were permanent residents. The kid—his name was Joey and he was
 ten—was a polio case who hadn't walked for over a year, and his
 mother was a waitress at a roadside joint named the Sea Shell Diner.
 There wasn't any Mr. Pond. I guessed there never had been, which would
 explain why Ethel acted so tough and sullen.


 We were halfway through supper when I remembered something the kid had
 said.


 ""Who's Charlie?"" I asked.


 Doc frowned at his plate. ""The kid had a dog named Charlie, a big
 shaggy mutt with only one eye and no love for anybody but the boy. The
 dog isn't coming home. He was run down by a car on the highway while
 Joey was hospitalized with polio.""


 ""Tough,"" I said, thinking of the kid sitting out there all day in his
 wheelchair, straining his eyes across the palmetto flats. ""You mean
 he's been waiting a
year
?""


 Doc nodded, seemed to lose interest in the Ponds, so I let the subject
 drop. We sat around after supper and polished off the rest of the
 beer. When we turned in around midnight I figured we wouldn't be
 staying long at the Twin Palms trailer court. It wasn't a very
 comfortable place.


 I was wrong there. It wasn't comfortable, but we stayed.


 I couldn't have said at first why we stuck, and if Doc could he didn't
 volunteer. Neither of us talked about it. We just went on living the
 way we were used to living, a few weeks here and a few there, all
 over the States.


 We'd hit the Florida west coast too late for the citrus season, so I
 went in for the fishing instead. I worked the fishing boats all the
 way from Tampa down to Fort Myers, not signing on with any of the
 commercial companies because I like to move quick when I get restless.
 I picked the independent deep-water snapper runs mostly, because the
 percentage is good there if you've got a strong back and tough hands.


 Snapper fishing isn't the sport it seems to the one-day tourists who
 flock along because the fee is cheap. You fish from a wide-beamed old
 scow, usually, with hand-lines instead of regular tackle, and you use
 multiple hooks that go down to the bottom where the big red ones are.
 There's no real thrill to it, as the one-day anglers find out quickly.
 A snapper puts up no more fight than a catfish and the biggest job is
 to haul out his dead weight once you've got him surfaced.


 Usually a pro like me sells his catch to the boat's owner or to some
 clumsy sport who wants his picture shot with a big one, and there's
 nearly always a jackpot—from a pool made up at the beginning of every
 run—for the man landing the biggest fish of the day. There's a knack
 to hooking the big ones, and when the jackpots were running good I
 only worked a day or so a week and spent the rest of the time lying
 around the trailer playing cribbage and drinking beer with Doc Shull.


 Usually it was the life of Riley, but somehow it wasn't enough in this
 place. We'd get about half-oiled and work up a promising argument
 about what was wrong with the world. Then, just when we'd got life
 looking its screwball funniest with our arguments one or the other of
 us would look out the window and see Joey Pond in his wheelchair,
 waiting for a one-eyed dog named Charlie to come trotting home across
 the palmetto flats. He was always there, day or night, until his
 mother came home from work and rolled him inside.


 It wasn't right or natural for a kid to wait like that for anything
 and it worried me. I even offered once to buy the kid another mutt but
 Ethel Pond told me quick to mind my own business. Doc explained that
 the kid didn't want another mutt because he had what Doc called a
 psychological block.


 ""Charlie was more than just a dog to him,"" Doc said. ""He was a sort of
 symbol because he offered the kid two things that no one else in the
 world could—security and independence. With Charlie keeping him
 company he felt secure, and he was independent of the kids who could
 run and play because he had Charlie to play with. If he took another
 dog now he'd be giving up more than Charlie. He'd be giving up
 everything that Charlie had meant to him, then there wouldn't be any
 point in living.""


 I could see it when Doc put it that way. The dog had spent more time
 with Joey than Ethel had, and the kid felt as safe with him as he'd
 have been with a platoon of Marines. And Charlie, being a one-man dog,
 had depended on Joey for the affection he wouldn't take from anybody
 else. The dog needed Joey and Joey needed him. Together, they'd been a
 natural.


 At first I thought it was funny that Joey never complained or cried
 when Charlie didn't come home, but Doc explained that it was all a
 part of this psychological block business. If Joey cried he'd be
 admitting that Charlie was lost. So he waited and watched, secure in
 his belief that Charlie would return.


 The Ponds got used to Doc and me being around, but they never got what
 you'd call intimate. Joey would laugh at some of the droll things Doc
 said, but his eyes always went back to the palmetto flats and the
 highway, looking for Charlie. And he never let anything interfere with
 his routine.


 That routine started every morning when old man Cloehessey, the
 postman, pedaled his bicycle out from Twin Palms to leave a handful of
 mail for the trailer-court tenants. Cloehessey would always make it a
 point to ride back by way of the Pond trailer and Joey would stop him
 and ask if he's seen anything of a one-eyed dog on his route that day.


 Old Cloehessey would lean on his bike and take off his sun helmet and
 mop his bald scalp, scowling while he pretended to think.


 Then he'd say, ""Not today, Joey,"" or, ""Thought so yesterday, but this
 fellow had two eyes on him. 'Twasn't Charlie.""


 Then he'd pedal away, shaking his head. Later on the handyman would
 come around to swap sanitary tanks under the trailers and Joey would
 ask him the same question. Once a month the power company sent out a
 man to read the electric meters and he was part of Joey's routine too.


 It was hard on Ethel. Sometimes the kid would dream at night that
 Charlie had come home and was scratching at the trailer ramp to be let
 in, and he'd wake Ethel and beg her to go out and see. When that
 happened Doc and I could hear Ethel talking to him, low and steady,
 until all hours of the morning, and when he finally went back to sleep
 we'd hear her open the cupboard and take out the gin bottle.


 But there came a night that was more than Ethel could take, a night
 that changed Joey's routine and a lot more with it. It left a mark
 you've seen yourself—everybody has that's got eyes to see—though
 you never knew what made it. Nobody ever knew that but Joey and Ethel
 Pond and Doc and me.


 Doc and I were turning in around midnight that night when the kid sang
 out next door. We heard Ethel get up and go to him, and we got up too
 and opened a beer because we knew neither of us would sleep any more
 till she got Joey quiet again. But this night was different. Ethel
 hadn't talked to the kid long when he yelled, ""Charlie!
Charlie!
""
 and after that we heard both of them bawling.


 A little later Ethel came out into the moonlight and shut the trailer
 door behind her. She looked rumpled and beaten, her hair straggling
 damply on her shoulders and her eyes puffed and red from crying. The
 gin she'd had hadn't helped any either.


 She stood for a while without moving, then she looked up at the sky
 and said something I'm not likely to forget.


 ""Why couldn't You give the kid a break?"" she said, not railing or
 anything but loud enough for us to hear. ""You, up there—what's
 another lousy one-eyed mutt to You?""


 Doc and I looked at each other in the half-dark of our own trailer.
 ""She's done it, Roy,"" Doc said.


 I knew what he meant and wished I didn't. Ethel had finally told the
 kid that Charlie wasn't coming back, not ever.


 That's why I was worried about Joey when I came home the next evening
 and found him watching the sky instead of the palmetto flats. It meant
 he'd given up waiting for Charlie. And the quiet way the kid spoke of
 moving the stars around worried me more, because it sounded outright
 crazy.


 Not that you could blame him for going off his head. It was tough
 enough to be pinned to a wheelchair without being able to wiggle so
 much as a toe. But to lose his dog in the bargain....


 I was on my third beer when Doc Shull rolled in with a big package
 under his arm. Doc was stone sober, which surprised me, and he was hot
 and tired from a shopping trip to Tampa, which surprised me more. It
 was when he ripped the paper off his package, though, that I thought
 he'd lost his mind.


 ""Books for Joey,"" Doc said. ""Ethel and I agreed this morning that the
 boy needs another interest to occupy his time now, and since he can't
 go to school I'm going to teach him here.""


 He went on to explain that Ethel hadn't had the heart the night
 before, desperate as she was, to tell the kid the whole truth. She'd
 told him instead, quoting an imaginary customer at the Sea Shell
 Diner, that a tourist car with Michigan license plates had picked
 Charlie up on the highway and taken him away. It was a good enough
 story. Joey still didn't know that Charlie was dead, but his waiting
 was over because no dog could be expected to find his way home from
 Michigan.


 ""We've got to give the boy another interest,"" Doc said, putting away
 the books and puncturing another beer can. ""Joey has a remarkable
 talent for concentration—most handicapped children have—that could
 be the end of him if it isn't diverted into safe channels.""


 I thought the kid had cracked up already and said so.


 ""Moving
stars
?"" Doc said when I told him. ""Good Lord, Roy—""
Ethel Pond knocked just then, interrupting him. She came in and had a
 beer with us and talked to Doc about his plan for educating Joey at
 home. But she couldn't tell us anything more about the kid's new
 fixation than we already knew. When she asked him why he stared up at
 the sky like that he'd say only that he wants something to remember
 Charlie by.


 It was about nine o'clock, when Ethel went home to cook supper. Doc
 and I knocked off our cribbage game and went outside with our folding
 chairs to get some air. It was then that the first star moved.


 It moved all of a sudden, the way any shooting star does, and shot
 across the sky in a curving, blue-white streak of fire. I didn't pay
 much attention, but Doc nearly choked on his beer.


 ""Roy,"" he said, ""that was Sirius!
It moved!
""


 I didn't see anything serious about it and said so. You can see a
 dozen or so stars zip across the sky on any clear night if you're in
 the mood to look up.


 ""Not serious, you fool,"" Doc said. ""The
star
Sirius—the Dog Star,
 it's called—it moved a good sixty degrees,
then stopped dead
!""


 I sat up and took notice then, partly because the star really had
 stopped instead of burning out the way a falling star seems to do,
 partly because anything that excites Doc Shull that much is something
 to think about.


 We watched the star like two cats at a mouse-hole, but it didn't move
 again. After a while a smaller one did, though, and later in the night
 a whole procession of them streaked across the sky and fell into place
 around the first one, forming a pattern that didn't make any sense to
 us. They stopped moving around midnight and we went to bed, but
 neither of us got to sleep right away.


 ""Maybe we ought to look for another interest in life ourselves instead
 of drumming up one for Joey,"" Doc said. He meant it as a joke but it
 had a shaky sound; ""Something besides getting beered up every night,
 for instance.""


 ""You think we've got the d.t.'s from drinking
beer
?"" I asked.


 Doc laughed at that, sounding more like his old self. ""No, Roy. No
 two people ever had instantaneous and identical hallucinations.""


 ""Look,"" I said. ""I know this sounds crazy but maybe Joey—""


 Doc wasn't amused any more. ""Don't be a fool, Roy. If those stars
 really moved you can be sure of two things—Joey had nothing to do
 with it, and the papers will explain everything tomorrow.""


 He was wrong on one count at least.


 The papers next day were packed with scareheads three inches high but
 none of them explained anything. The radio commentators quoted every
 authority they could reach, and astronomers were going crazy
 everywhere. It just couldn't happen, they said.


 Doc and I went over the news column by column that night and I learned
 more about the stars than I'd learned in a lifetime. Doc, as I've said
 before, is an educated man, and what he couldn't recall offhand about
 astronomy the newspapers quoted by chapter and verse. They ran
 interviews with astronomers at Harvard Observatory and Mount Wilson
 and Lick and Flagstaff and God knows where else, but nobody could
 explain why all of those stars would change position then stop.


 It set me back on my heels to learn that Sirius was twice as big as
 the Sun and more than twice as heavy, that it was three times as hot
 and had a little dark companion that was more solid than lead but
 didn't give off enough light to be seen with the naked eye. This
 little companion—astronomers called it the ""Pup"" because Sirius was
 the Dog Star—hadn't moved, which puzzled the astronomers no end. I
 suggested to Doc, only half joking, that maybe the Pup had stayed put
 because it wasn't bright enough to suit Joey's taste, but Doc called
 me down sharp.


 ""Don't joke about Joey,"" he said sternly. ""Getting back to
 Sirius—it's so far away that its light needs eight and a half years
 to reach us. That means it started moving when Joey was only eighteen
 months old. The speed of light is a universal constant, Roy, and
 astronomers say it can't be changed.""


 ""They said the stars couldn't be tossed around like pool balls, too,""
 I pointed out. ""I'm not saying that Joey really moved those damn
 stars, Doc, but if he did he could have moved the light along with
 them, couldn't he?""


 But Doc wouldn't argue the point. ""I'm going out for air,"" he said.


 I trailed along, but we didn't get farther than Joey's wheelchair.


 There he sat, tense and absorbed, staring up at the night sky. Doc and
 I followed his gaze, the way you do automatically when somebody on the
 street ahead of you cranes his neck at something. We looked up just
 in time to see the stars start moving again.


 The first one to go was a big white one that slanted across the sky
 like a Roman candle fireball—
zip
, like that—and stopped dead
 beside the group that had collected around Sirius.


 Doc said, ""There went Altair,"" and his voice sounded like he had just
 run a mile.


 That was only the beginning. During the next hour forty or fifty more
 stars flashed across the sky and joined the group that had moved the
 night before. The pattern they made still didn't look like anything in
 particular.


 I left Doc shaking his head at the sky and went over to give Joey, who
 had called it a night and was hand-rolling his wheelchair toward the
 Pond trailer, a boost up the entrance ramp. I pushed him inside where
 Doc couldn't hear, then I asked him how things were going.


 ""Slow, Roy,"" he said. ""I've got 'most a hundred to go, yet.""


 ""Then you're really moving those stars up there?""


 He looked surprised. ""Sure, it's not so hard once you know how.""


 The odds were even that he was pulling my leg, but I went ahead anyway
 and asked another question.


 ""I can't make head or tail of it, Joey,"" I said. ""What're you making
 up there?""


 He gave me a very small smile.


 ""You'll know when I'm through,"" he said.


 I told Doc about that after we'd bunked in, but he said I should not
 encourage the kid in his crazy thinking. ""Joey's heard everybody
 talking about those stars moving, the radio newscasters blared about
 it, so he's excited too. But he's got a lot more imagination than most
 people, because he's a cripple, and he could go off on a crazy tangent
 because he's upset about Charlie. The thing to do is give him a
 logical explanation instead of letting him think his fantasy is a
 fact.""


 Doc was taking all this so hard—because it was upsetting things he'd
 taken for granted as being facts all his life, like those astronomers
 who were going nuts in droves all over the world. I didn't realize how
 upset Doc really was, though, till he woke me up at about 4:00
 a.m.


 ""I can't sleep for thinking about those stars,"" he said, sitting on
 the edge of my bunk. ""Roy, I'm
scared
.""


 That from Doc was something I'd never expected to hear. It startled me
 wide enough awake to sit up in the dark and listen while he unloaded
 his worries.


 ""I'm afraid,"" Doc said, ""because what is happening up there isn't
 right or natural. It just can't be, yet it is.""


 It was so quiet when he paused that I could hear the blood swishing in
 my ears. Finally Doc said, ""Roy, the galaxy we live in is as
 delicately balanced as a fine watch. If that balance is upset too far
 our world will be affected drastically.""


 Ordinarily I wouldn't have argued with Doc on his own ground, but I
 could see he was painting a mental picture of the whole universe
 crashing together like a Fourth of July fireworks display and I was
 afraid to let him go on.


 ""The trouble with you educated people,"" I said, ""is that you think
 your experts have got everything figured out, that there's nothing in
 the world their slide-rules can't pin down. Well, I'm an illiterate
 mugg, but I know that your astronomers can measure the stars till
 they're blue in the face and they'll never learn who
put
those stars
 there. So how do they know that whoever put them there won't move them
 again? I've always heard that if a man had faith enough he could move
 mountains. Well, if a man has the faith in himself that Joey's got
 maybe he could move stars, too.""


 Doc sat quiet for a minute.


 ""'
There are more things, Horatio....
'"" he began, then laughed. ""A
 line worn threadbare by three hundred years of repetition but as apt
 tonight as ever, Roy. Do you really believe Joey is moving those
 stars?""


 ""Why not?"" I came back. ""It's as good an answer as any the experts
 have come up with.""


 Doc got up and went back to his own bunk. ""Maybe you're right. We'll
 find out tomorrow.""


 And we did. Doc did, rather, while I was hard at work hauling red
 snappers up from the bottom of the Gulf.
I got home a little earlier than usual that night, just before it got
 really dark. Joey was sitting as usual all alone in his wheelchair. In
 the gloom I could see a stack of books on the grass beside him, books
 Doc had given him to study. The thing that stopped me was that Joey
 was staring at his feet as if they were the first ones he'd ever seen,
 and he had the same look of intense concentration on his face that I'd
 seen when he was watching the stars.


 I didn't know what to say to him, thinking maybe I'd better not
 mention the stars. But Joey spoke first.


 ""Roy,"" he said, without taking his eyes off his toes, ""did you know
 that Doc is an awfully wise man?""


 I said I'd always thought so, but why?


 ""Doc said this morning that I ought not to move any more stars,"" the
 kid said. ""He says I ought to concentrate instead on learning how to
 walk again so I can go to Michigan and find Charlie.""


 For a minute I was mad enough to brain Doc Shull if he'd been handy.
 Anybody that would pull a gag like that on a crippled, helpless
 kid....


 ""Doc says that if I can do what I've been doing to the stars then it
 ought to be easy to move my own feet,"" Joey said. ""And he's right,
 Roy. So I'm not going to move any more stars. I'm going to move my
 feet.""


 He looked up at me with his small, solemn smile. ""It took me a whole
 day to learn how to move that first star, Roy, but I could do this
 after only a couple of hours. Look....""


 And he wiggled the toes on both feet.


 It's a pity things don't happen in life like they do in books, because
 a first-class story could be made out of Joey Pond's knack for moving
 things by looking at them. In a book Joey might have saved the world
 or destroyed it, depending on which line would interest the most
 readers and bring the writer the fattest check, but of course it
 didn't really turn out either way. It ended in what Doc Shull called
 an anticlimax, leaving everybody happy enough except a few astronomers
 who like mysteries anyway or they wouldn't be astronomers in the first
 place.


 The stars that had been moved stayed where they were, but the pattern
 they had started was never finished. That unfinished pattern won't
 ever go away, in case you've wondered about it—it's up there in the
 sky where you can see it any clear night—but it will never be
 finished because Joey Pond lost interest in it when he learned to walk
 again.


 Walking was a slow business with Joey at first because his legs had
 got thin and weak—partially atrophied muscles, Doc said—and it took
 time to make them round and strong again. But in a couple of weeks he
 was stumping around on crutches and after that he never went near his
 wheelchair again.


 Ethel sent him to school at Sarasota by bus and before summer vacation
 time came around he was playing softball and fishing in the Gulf with
 a gang of other kids on Sundays.


 School opened up a whole new world to Joey and he fitted himself into
 the routine as neat as if he'd been doing it all his life. He learned
 a lot there and he forgot a lot that he'd learned for himself by being
 alone. Before we realized what was happening he was just like any
 other ten-year-old, full of curiosity and the devil, with no more
 power to move things by staring at them than anybody else had.


 I think he actually forgot about those stars along with other things
 that had meant so much to him when he was tied to his wheelchair and
 couldn't do anything but wait and think.


 For instance, a scrubby little terrier followed him home from Twin
 Palms one day and Ethel let him keep it. He fed the pup and washed it
 and named it Dugan, and after that he never said anything more about
 going to Michigan to find Charlie. It was only natural, of course,
 because kids—normal kids—forget their pain quickly. It's a sort of
 defense mechanism, Doc says, against the disappointments of this life.


 When school opened again in the fall Ethel sold her trailer and got a
 job in Tampa where Joey could walk to school instead of going by bus.
 When they were gone the Twin Palms trailer court was so lonesome and
 dead that Doc and I pulled out and went down to the Lake Okechobee
 country for the sugar cane season. We never heard from Ethel and Joey
 again.


 We've moved several times since; we're out in the San Joaquin Valley
 just now, with the celery croppers. But everywhere we go we're
 reminded of them. Every time we look up at a clear night sky we see
 what Doc calls the Joey Pond Stellar Monument, which is nothing but a
 funny sort of pattern roughed in with a hundred or so stars of all
 sizes and colors.


 The body of it is so sketchy that you'd never make out what it's
 supposed to be unless you knew already what you were looking for. To
 us the head of a dog is fairly plain. If you know enough to fill in
 the gaps you can see it was meant to be a big shaggy dog with only one
 eye.


 Doc says that footloose migratories like him and me forget old
 associations as quick as kids do—and for the same good reason—so I'm
 not especially interested now in where Ethel and Joey Pond are or how
 they're doing. But there's one thing I'll always wonder about, now
 that there's no way of ever knowing for sure.


 I wish I'd asked Joey or Ethel, before they moved away, how Charlie
 lost that other eye.

 GREEN

 BERET
By TOM PURDOM
It's not so much the decisions a man does make that mark
 him as a Man—but the ones he refrains from making. Like the
 decision ""I've had enough!""
Illustrated by Schoenherr
Read locked the door and drew his pistol. Sergeant Rashid handed
 Premier Umluana the warrant.


 ""We're from the UN Inspector Corps,"" Sergeant Rashid said. ""I'm
 very sorry, but we have to arrest you and bring you in for trial
 by the World Court.""


 If Umluana noticed Read's gun, he didn't show it. He read the
 warrant carefully. When he finished, he said something in Dutch.


 ""I don't know your language,"" Rashid said.


 ""Then I'll speak English."" Umluana was a small man with wrinkled
 brow, glasses and a mustache. His skin was a shade lighter than
 Read's. ""The Inspector General doesn't have the power to arrest a
 head of state—especially the Premier of Belderkan. Now, if
 you'll excuse me, I must return to my party.""


 In the other room people laughed and talked. Glasses clinked in
 the late afternoon. Read knew two armed men stood just outside
 the door. ""If you leave, Premier, I'll have to shoot you.""


 ""I don't think so,"" Umluana said. ""No, if you kill me, all Africa
 will rise against the world. You don't want me dead. You want me
 in court.""


 Read clicked off the safety.


 ""Corporal Read is very young,"" Rashid said, ""but he's a crack
 shot. That's why I brought him with me. I think he
likes
to
 shoot, too.""


 Umluana turned back to Rashid a second too soon. He saw the
 sergeant's upraised hand before it collided with his neck.


 ""Help!
Kidnap.
""


 Rashid judo chopped him and swung the inert body over his
 shoulders. Read pulled a flat grenade from his vest pocket. He
 dropped it and yellow psycho gas hissed from the valve.


 ""Let's be off,"" Rashid said.


 The door lock snapped as they went out the window. Two men with
 rifles plunged into the gas; sighing, they fell to the floor in a
 catatonic trance.


 A little car skimmed across the lawn. Bearing the Scourge of
 Africa, Rashid struggled toward it. Read walked backward,
 covering their retreat.


 The car stopped, whirling blades holding it a few inches off the
 lawn. They climbed in.


 ""How did it go?"" The driver and another inspector occupied the
 front seat.


 ""They'll be after us in half a minute.""


 The other inspector carried a light machine gun and a box of
 grenades. ""I better cover,"" he said.


 ""Thanks,"" Rashid said.


 The inspector slid out of the car and ran to a clump of bushes.
 The driver pushed in the accelerator. As they swerved toward the
 south, Read saw a dozen armed men run out of the house. A grenade
 arced from the bushes and the pursuers recoiled from the cloud
 that rose before them.


 ""Is he all right?"" the driver asked.


 ""I don't think I hurt him."" Rashid took a syrette from his vest
 pocket. ""Well, Read, it looks like we're in for a fight. In a few
 minutes Miaka Station will know we're coming. And God knows what
 will happen at the Game Preserve.""


 Read wanted to jump out of the car. He could die any minute. But
 he had set his life on a well-oiled track and he couldn't get off
 until they reached Geneva.


 ""They don't know who's coming,"" he said. ""They don't make them
 tough enough to stop this boy.""


 Staring straight ahead, he didn't see the sergeant smile.
Two types of recruits are accepted by the UN Inspector Corps:
 those with a fanatic loyalty to the ideals of peace and world
 order, and those who are loyal to nothing but themselves. Read
 was the second type.


 A tall, lanky Negro he had spent his school days in one of the
 drab suburbs that ring every prosperous American city. It was the
 home of factory workers, clerks, semiskilled technicians, all who
 do the drudge work of civilization and know they will never do
 more. The adults spent their days with television, alcohol and
 drugs; the young spent their days with gangs, sex, television and
 alcohol. What else was there? Those who could have told him
 neither studied nor taught at his schools. What he saw on the
 concrete fields between the tall apartment houses marked the
 limits of life's possibilities.


 He had belonged to a gang called The Golden Spacemen. ""Nobody
 fools with me,"" he bragged. ""When Harry Read's out, there's a
 tiger running loose."" No one knew how many times he nearly ran
 from other clubs, how carefully he picked the safest spot on the
 battle line.


 ""A man ought to be a man,"" he once told a girl. ""He ought to do a
 man's work. Did you ever notice how our fathers look, how they
 sleep so much? I don't want to be like that. I want to be
 something proud.""


 He joined the UN Inspector Corps at eighteen, in 1978. The
 international cops wore green berets, high buttonless boots, bush
 jackets. They were very special men.


 For the first time in his life, his father said something about
 his ambitions.


 ""Don't you like America, Harry? Do you
want
to be without a
 country? This is the best country in the world. All my life I've
 made a good living. Haven't you had everything you ever wanted?
 I've been a king compared to people overseas. Why, you stay here
 and go to trade school and in two years you'll be living just
 like me.""


 ""I don't want that,"" Read said.


 ""What do you mean, you don't want that?""


 ""You could join the American Army,"" his mother said. ""That's as
 good as a trade school. If you have to be a soldier.""


 ""I want to be a UN man. I've already enlisted. I'm in! What do
 you care what I do?""


 The UN Inspector Corps had been founded to enforce the Nuclear
 Disarmament Treaty of 1966. Through the years it had acquired
 other jobs. UN men no longer went unarmed. Trained to use small
 arms and gas weapons, they guarded certain borders, bodyguarded
 diplomats and UN officials, even put down riots that threatened
 international peace. As the UN evolved into a strong world
 government, the UN Inspector Corps steadily acquired new powers.


 Read went through six months training on Madagascar.


 Twice he nearly got expelled for picking fights with smaller men.
 Rather than resign, he accepted punishment which assigned him to
 weeks of dull, filthy extra labor. He hated the restrictions and
 the iron fence of regulations. He hated boredom, loneliness and
 isolation.


 And yet he responded with enthusiasm. They had given him a job. A
 job many people considered important.


 He took his turn guarding the still disputed borders of Korea. He
 served on the rescue teams that patrol the busy Polar routes. He
 mounted guard at the 1980 World's Fair in Rangoon.


 ""I liked Rangoon,"" he even told a friend. ""I even liked Korea.
 But I think I liked the Pole job best. You sit around playing
 cards and shooting the bull and then there's a plane crash or
 something and you go out and win a medal. That's great for me.
 I'm lazy and I like excitement.""
One power implied in the UN Charter no Secretary General or
 Inspector General had ever tried to use. The power to arrest any
 head of state whose country violated international law. Could the
 World Court try and imprison a politician who had conspired to
 attack another nation?


 For years Africa had been called ""The South America of the Old
 World."" Revolution followed revolution. Colonies became
 democracies. Democracies became dictatorships or dissolved in
 civil war. Men planted bases on the moon and in four years,
 1978-82, ringed the world with matter transmitters; but the black
 population of Africa still struggled toward political equality.


 Umluana took control of Belderkan in 1979. The tiny, former Dutch
 colony, had been a tottering democracy for ten years. The very
 day he took control the new dictator and his African party began
 to build up the Belderkan Army. For years he had preached a new
 Africa, united, free of white masters, the home of a vigorous and
 perfect Negro society. His critics called him a hypocritical
 racist, an opportunist using the desires of the African people to
 build himself an empire.


 He began a propaganda war against neighboring South Africa,
 promising the liberation of that strife-torn land. Most Negro
 leaders, having just won representation in the South African
 Parliament, told him to liberate his own country. They believed
 they could use their first small voice in the government to win
 true freedom for their people.


 But the radio assault and the arms buildup continued. Early in
 1982, South Africa claimed the Belderkan Army exceeded the size
 agreed to in the Disarmament Treaty. The European countries and
 some African nations joined in the accusation. China called the
 uproar a vicious slur on a new African nation. The United States
 and Russia, trying not to get entangled, asked for more
 investigation by the UN.


 But the evidence was clear. Umluana was defying world law. If he
 got away with it, some larger and more dangerous nation might
 follow his precedent. And the arms race would begin again.


 The Inspector General decided. They would enter Belderkan, arrest
 Umluana and try him by due process before the World Court. If the
 plan succeeded, mankind would be a long step farther from nuclear
 war.


 Read didn't know much about the complicated political reasons for
 the arrest. He liked the Corp and he liked being in the Corp. He
 went where they sent him and did what they told him to do.
The car skimmed above the tree-tops. The driver and his two
 passengers scanned the sky.


 A plane would have been a faster way to get out of the country.
 But then they would have spent hours flying over Africa, with
 Belderkan fighters in hot pursuit, other nations joining the
 chase and the world uproar gaining volume. By transmitter, if all
 went well, they could have Umluana in Geneva in an hour.


 They were racing toward Miaka, a branch transmitter station. From
 Miaka they would transmit to the Belderkan Preserve, a famous
 tourist attraction whose station could transmit to any point on
 the globe. Even now a dozen inspectors were taking over the Game
 Preserve station and manning its controls.


 They had made no plans to take over Miaka. They planned to get
 there before it could be defended.


 ""There's no military base near Miaka,"" Rashid said. ""We might get
 there before the Belderkans.""


 ""Here comes our escort,"" Read said.


 A big car rose from the jungle. This one had a recoilless rifle
 mounted on the roof. The driver and the gunner waved and fell in
 behind them.


 ""One thing,"" Read said, ""I don't think they'll shoot at us while
he's
in the car.""


 ""Don't be certain, corporal. All these strong-arm movements are
 alike. I'll bet Umluana's lieutenants are hoping he'll become a
 dead legend. Then they can become live conquerors.""


 Sergeant Rashid came from Cairo. He had degrees in science and
 history from Cambridge but only the Corp gave him work that
 satisfied his conscience. He hated war. It was that simple.


 Read looked back. He saw three spots of sunlight about two
 hundred feet up and a good mile behind.


 ""Here they come, Sarge.""


 Rashid turned his head. He waved frantically. The two men in the
 other car waved back.


 ""Shall I duck under the trees?"" the driver asked.


 ""Not yet. Not until we have to.""


 Read fingered the machine gun he had picked up when he got in the
 car. He had never been shot at. Twice he had faced an unarmed
 mob, but a few shots had sent them running.


 Birds flew screaming from their nests. Monkeys screeched and
 threw things at the noisy, speeding cars. A little cloud of birds
 surrounded each vehicle.


 The escort car made a sharp turn and charged their pursuers. The
 big rifle fired twice. Read saw the Belderkan cars scatter.
 Suddenly machine-gun bullets cracked and whined beside him.


 ""Evade,"" Rashid said. ""Don't go down.""


 Without losing any forward speed, the driver took them straight
 up. Read's stomach bounced.


 A shell exploded above them. The car rocked. He raised his eyes
 and saw a long crack in the roof.


 ""Hit the floor,"" Rashid said.


 They knelt on the cramped floor. Rashid put on his gas mask and
 Read copied him. Umluana breathed like a furnace, still
 unconscious from the injection Rashid had given him.
I can't do anything
, Read thought.
They're too far away to
 shoot back. All we can do is run.
The sky was clear and blue. The jungle was a noisy bazaar of
 color. In the distance guns crashed. He listened to shells
 whistle by and the whipcrack of machine-gun bullets. The car
 roller-coastered up and down. Every time a shell passed, he
 crawled in waves down his own back.


 Another explosion, this time very loud.


 Rashid raised his eyes above the seat and looked out the rear
 window. ""Two left. Keep down, Read.""


 ""Can't we go down?"" Read said.


 ""They'll get to Miaka before us.""


 He shut his eyes when he heard another loud explosion.


 Sergeant Rashid looked out the window again. He swore bitterly in
 English and Egyptian. Read raised his head. The two cars behind
 them weren't fighting each other. A long way back the tree-tops
 burned.


 ""How much farther?"" Rashid said. The masks muffled their voices.


 ""There it is now. Shall I take us right in?""


 ""I think you'd better.""
The station was a glass diamond in a small clearing. The driver
 slowed down, then crashed through the glass walls and hovered by
 the transmitter booth.


 Rashid opened the door and threw out two grenades. Read jumped
 out and the two of them struggled toward the booth with Umluana.
 The driver, pistol in hand, ran for the control panel.


 There were three technicians in the station and no passengers.
 All three panicked when the psycho gas enveloped them. They ran
 howling for the jungle.


 Through the window of his mask, Read saw their pursuers land in
 the clearing. Machine-gun bullets raked the building. They got
 Umluana in the booth and hit the floor. Read took aim and opened
 fire on the largest car.


 ""Now, I can shoot back,"" he said. ""Now we'll see what they do.""


 ""Are you ready, Rashid?"" yelled the driver.


 ""Man, get us out of here!""


 The booth door shut. When it opened, they were at the Game
 Preserve.


 The station jutted from the side of a hill. A glass-walled
 waiting room surrounded the bank of transmitter booths. Read
 looked out the door and saw his first battlefield.


 Directly in front of him, his head shattered by a bullet, a dead
 inspector lay behind an overturned couch.


 Read had seen dozens of training films taken during actual
 battles or after atomic attacks. He had laughed when other
 recruits complained. ""That's the way this world is. You people
 with the weak stomachs better get used to it.""


 Now he slid against the rear wall of the transmitter booth.


 A wounded inspector crawled across the floor to the booth. Read
 couldn't see his wound, only the pain scratched on his face and
 the blood he deposited on the floor.


 ""Did you get Umluana?"" he asked Sergeant Rashid.


 ""He's in the booth. What's going on?"" Rashid's Middle East Oxford
 seemed more clipped than ever.


 ""They hit us with two companies of troops a few minutes ago. I
 think half our men are wounded.""


 ""Can we get out of here?""


 ""They machine-gunned the controls.""


 Rashid swore. ""You heard him, Read! Get out there and help those
 men.""


 He heard the screams of the wounded, the crack of rifles and
 machine guns, all the terrifying noise of war. But since his
 eighteenth year he had done everything his superiors told him to
 do.


 He started crawling toward an easy-chair that looked like good
 cover. A bullet cracked above his head, so close he felt the
 shock wave. He got up, ran panicky, crouched, and dove behind the
 chair.


 An inspector cracked the valve on a smoke grenade. A white fog
 spread through the building. They could see anyone who tried to
 rush them but the besiegers couldn't pick out targets.


 Above the noise, he heard Rashid.


 ""I'm calling South Africa Station for a copter. It's the only way
 out of here. Until it comes, we've got to hold them back.""


 Read thought of the green beret he had stuffed in his pocket that
 morning. He stuck it on his head and cocked it. He didn't need
 plain clothes anymore and he wanted to wear at least a part of
 his uniform.


 Bullets had completely shattered the wall in front of him. He
 stared through the murk, across the broken glass. He was Corporal
 Harry Read, UN Inspector Corps—a very special man. If he didn't
 do a good job here, he wasn't the man he claimed to be. This
 might be the only real test he would ever face.
He heard a shout in rapid French. He turned to his right. Men in
 red loincloths ran zigzagging toward the station. They carried
 light automatic rifles. Half of them wore gas masks.


 ""Shoot the masks,"" he yelled. ""Aim for the masks.""


 The machine gun kicked and chattered on his shoulder. He picked a
 target and squeezed off a burst. Tensely, he hunted for another
 mask. Three grenades arced through the air and yellow gas spread
 across the battlefield. The attackers ran through it. A few yards
 beyond the gas, some of them turned and ran for their own lines.
 In a moment only half a dozen masked men still advanced. The
 inspectors fired a long, noisy volley. When they stopped only
 four attackers remained on their feet. And they were running for
 cover.


 The attackers had come straight up a road that led from the Game
 Preserve to the station. They had not expected any resistance.
 The UN men had already taken over the station, chased out the
 passengers and technicians and taken up defense positions; they
 had met the Belderkans with a dozen grenades and sent them
 scurrying for cover. The fight so far had been vicious but
 disorganized. But the Belderkans had a few hundred men and knew
 they had wrecked the transmitter controls.


 The first direct attack had been repulsed. They could attack many
 more times and continue to spray the building with bullets. They
 could also try to go around the hill and attack the station from
 above; if they did, the inspectors had a good view of the hill
 and should see them going up.


 The inspectors had taken up good defensive positions. In spite of
 their losses, they still had enough firepower to cover the area
 surrounding the station.


 Read surveyed his sector of fire. About two hundred yards to his
 left, he saw the top of a small ditch. Using the ditch for cover,
 the Belderkans could sneak to the top of the hill.


 Gas grenades are only three inches long. They hold cubic yards of
 gas under high pressure. Read unclipped a telescoping rod from
 his vest pocket. He opened it and a pair of sights flipped up. A
 thin track ran down one side.


 He had about a dozen grenades left, three self-propelling. He
 slid an SP grenade into the rod's track and estimated windage and
 range. Sighting carefully, not breathing, muscles relaxed, the
 rod rock steady, he fired and lobbed the little grenade into the
 ditch. He dropped another grenade beside it.


 The heavy gas would lie there for hours.


 Sergeant Rashid ran crouched from man to man. He did what he
 could to shield the wounded.


 ""Well, corporal, how are you?""


 ""Not too bad, sergeant. See that ditch out there? I put a little
 gas in it.""


 ""Good work. How's your ammunition?""


 ""A dozen grenades. Half a barrel of shells.""


 ""The copter will be here in half an hour. We'll put Umluana on,
 then try to save ourselves. Once he's gone, I think we ought to
 surrender.""


 ""How do you think they'll treat us?""


 ""That we'll have to see.""


 An occasional bullet cracked and whined through the misty room.
 Near him a man gasped frantically for air. On the sunny field a
 wounded man screamed for help.


 ""There's a garage downstairs,"" Rashid said. ""In case the copter
 doesn't get here on time, I've got a man filling wine bottles
 with gasoline.""


 ""We'll stop them, Sarge. Don't worry.""
Rashid ran off. Read stared across the green land and listened to
 the pound of his heart. What were the Belderkans planning? A mass
 frontal attack? To sneak in over the top of the hill?


 He didn't think, anymore than a rabbit thinks when it lies hiding
 from the fox or a panther thinks when it crouches on a branch
 above the trail. His skin tightened and relaxed on his body.


 ""Listen,"" said a German.


 Far down the hill he heard the deep-throated rumble of a big
 motor.


 ""Armor,"" the German said.


 The earth shook. The tank rounded the bend. Read watched the
 squat, angular monster until its stubby gun pointed at the
 station. It stopped less than two hundred yards away.


 A loud-speaker blared.


 ATTENTION UN SOLDIERS.

 ATTENTION UN SOLDIERS.

 YOU MAY THINK US SAVAGES

 BUT WE HAVE MODERN WEAPONS.

 WE HAVE ATOMIC WARHEADS,

 ALL GASES, ROCKETS

 AND FLAME THROWERS. IF

 YOU DO NOT SURRENDER

 OUR PREMIER, WE WILL DESTROY YOU.



 ""They know we don't have any big weapons,"" Read said. ""They know
 we have only gas grenades and small arms.""


 He looked nervously from side to side. They couldn't bring the
 copter in with that thing squatting out there.


 A few feet away, sprawled behind a barricade of tables, lay a man
 in advanced shock. His deadly white skin shone like ivory. They
 wouldn't even look like that. One nuclear shell from that gun and
 they'd be vaporized. Or perhaps the tank had sonic projectors;
 then the skin would peel off their bones. Or they might be
 burned, or cut up by shrapnel, or gassed with some new mist their
 masks couldn't filter.


 Read shut his eyes. All around him he heard heavy breathing,
 mumbled comments, curses. Clothes rustled as men moved restlessly.


 But already the voice of Sergeant Rashid resounded in the murky
 room.


 ""We've got to knock that thing out before the copter comes.
 Otherwise, he can't land. I have six Molotov cocktails here. Who
 wants to go hunting with me?""


 For two years Read had served under Sergeant Rashid. To him, the
 sergeant was everything a UN inspector should be. Rashid's
 devotion to peace had no limits.


 Read's psych tests said pride alone drove him on. That was good
 enough for the UN; they only rejected men whose loyalties might
 conflict with their duties. But an assault on the tank required
 something more than a hunger for self-respect.


 Read had seen the inspector who covered their getaway. He had
 watched their escort charge three-to-one odds. He had seen
 another inspector stay behind at Miaka Station. And here, in this
 building, lay battered men and dead men.


 All UN inspectors. All part of his life.


 And he was part of their life. Their blood, their sacrifice, and
 pain, had become a part of him.


 ""I'll take a cocktail, Sarge.""


 ""Is that Read?""


 ""Who else did you expect?""


 ""Nobody. Anybody else?""


 ""I'll go,"" the Frenchman said. ""Three should be enough. Give us a
 good smoke screen.""
Rashid snapped orders. He put the German inspector in charge of
 Umluana. Read, the Frenchman and himself, he stationed at
 thirty-foot intervals along the floor.


 ""Remember,"" Rashid said. ""We have to knock out that gun.""


 Read had given away his machine gun. He held a gas-filled bottle
 in each hand. His automatic nestled in its shoulder holster.


 Rashid whistled.


 Dozens of smoke grenades tumbled through the air. Thick mist
 engulfed the tank. Read stood up and ran forward. He crouched but
 didn't zigzag. Speed counted most here.


 Gunfire shook the hill. The Belderkans couldn't see them but they
 knew what was going on and they fired systematically into the
 smoke.


 Bullets ploughed the ground beside him. He raised his head and
 found the dim silhouette of the tank. He tried not to think about
 bullets ploughing through his flesh.


 A bullet slammed into his hip. He fell on his back, screaming.
 ""Sarge.
Sarge.
""


 ""I'm hit, too,"" Rashid said. ""Don't stop if you can move.""
Listen to him. What's he got, a sprained ankle?
But he didn't feel any pain. He closed his eyes and threw himself
 onto his stomach. And nearly fainted from pain. He screamed and
 quivered. The pain stopped. He stretched out his hands, gripping
 the wine bottles, and inched forward. Pain stabbed him from
 stomach to knee.


 ""I can't move, Sarge.""


 ""Read, you've got to. I think you're the only—""


 ""What?""


 Guns clattered. Bullets cracked.


 ""Sergeant Rashid! Answer me.""


 He heard nothing but the lonely passage of the bullets in the
 mist.


 ""I'm a UN man,"" he mumbled. ""You people up there know what a UN
 man is? You know what happens when you meet one?""


 When he reached the tank, he had another bullet in his right arm.
 But they didn't know he was coming and when you get within ten
 feet of a tank, the men inside can't see you.


 He just had to stand up and drop the bottle down the gun barrel.
 That was all—with a broken hip and a wounded right arm.


 He knew they would see him when he stood up but he didn't think
 about that. He didn't think about Sergeant Rashid, about the
 complicated politics of Africa, about crowded market streets. He
 had to kill the tank. That was all he thought about. He had
 decided something in the world was more important than himself,
 but he didn't know it or realize the psychologists would be
 surprised to see him do this. He had made many decisions in the
 last few minutes. He had ceased to think about them or anything
 else.


 With his cigarette lighter, he lit the rag stuffed in the end of
 the bottle.


 Biting his tongue, he pulled himself up the front of the tank.
 His long arm stretched for the muzzle of the gun. He tossed the
 bottle down the dark throat.


 As he fell, the machine-gun bullets hit him in the chest, then in
 the neck. He didn't feel them. He had fainted the moment he felt
 the bottle leave his hand.


 The copter landed ten minutes later. Umluana left in a shower of
 bullets. A Russian private, the ranking man alive in the station,
 surrendered the survivors to the Belderkans.
His mother hung the Global Medal above the television set.


 ""He must have been brave,"" she said. ""We had a fine son.""


 ""He was our only son,"" her husband said. ""What did he volunteer
 for? Couldn't somebody else have done it?""


 His wife started to cry. Awkwardly, he embraced her. He wondered
 what his son had wanted that he couldn't get at home.

""I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,"" said
 Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress
 whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar
 system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and
 there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.


 ""And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who
I
am,""
 replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels
 had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the
 comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked
 smile.


 The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space
 ship
Kismet
, enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer
 Fogarty, the
Kismet's
rotund commanding officer. The
Kismet
was
 blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from
 Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two
 hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.


 Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. ""Don't
 pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are—always
 putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.""


 ""Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?""
 Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her
 scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.
 Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise
 perfect body—her slightly over-sized mouth.


 She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had
 cancelled her passage on the
Kismet
when she learned that Carlton
 was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return
 to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video
 films. And the
Kismet
was the only first class space ship flying to
 Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.


 ""I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've
 ever seen,"" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like
 a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely
 being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between
 Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.


 ""And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,"" said
 Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a
 little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.


 Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. ""It's all very pretty,
 my dear,"" he said smugly. ""But we've seen it all before and in space
 you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.""


 Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very
 unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.
 Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a
 newcomer standing at the door.
The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely
 five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March
 wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,
 weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost
 in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out
 of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.


 ""I beg your pardon,"" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.
 ""I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the
 gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.""


 Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. ""Why, I
 was ... I was ... I—"" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as
 she recovered her poise. ""Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek
 for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?""
 She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared
 with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.


 ""Oh,"" said the little old woman, ""I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was
 your son."" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief
 fit of hysteria.


 The Captain took command. ""Now, look here, Madam,"" he sputtered. ""What
 is it you want?""


 ""I really wanted to see you, Captain,"" she told him, her battered old
 shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. ""The
 Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I
 wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you
 see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years
 ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at
 all sure of which is legal."" She put one bird-like little hand to
 her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her
 support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the
 intrusion.


 ""It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so
 long as you sign it,"" he blustered. ""Just a mere formality anyway. You
 just sign it any way you like."" He paused, hoping that she would leave
 now that she had her information.


 ""Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,"" she said, but made no move whatsoever
 to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which
 withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly
 at him.


 His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, ""And now, Mrs.
 Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you
 know, this is a private lounge for the
first
class passengers.""


 Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. ""Yes, I know. It's lovely,
 isn't it? I'll just go out this way."" And before anyone could stop her,
 she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,
 stepping inside.


 ""That's my room, not the door out,"" Darling said loudly.


 ""So I see,"" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings
 with avid pleasure. ""It's such a pretty thing, all done up with
 mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie
 lying on the bed."" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment
 to examine it. ""You do wear something under it, don't you?""


 Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie
 away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the
 door, closing it behind her. ""Captain, this woman must GO!""


 ""I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very
 happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,"" she called over her shoulder
 as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down
 the companionway.
Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour
 when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up
 and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any
 other furniture besides the bed.


 ""Come in,"" she called in a small voice.


 Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,
 freckled face through the door. ""Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I
 could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.""


 ""Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you
 don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my
 children do it and I miss it so."" She gave him a wrinkled smile that
 was at once wistful and petulant.


 Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. ""Sure thing, Grandma.""
 He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found
 himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.
 He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins
 was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by
 herself. He put it on the floor.


 As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and
 battered shoes from the box, she asked him, ""Johnny, what was that
 paper I signed this afternoon?""


 ""Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You
 guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already
 done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your
 will until you reached your destination.""


 ""But why do we have to have a contract?""


 Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. ""Well, STAR—that's
 Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know—is one of
 the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The ""Big
 Thirteen,"" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck
 of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were
 scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,
 say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody
 on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just
 bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.
 In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And
 the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they
 won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it
 anymore anyway, but that's the law.""


 Grandma Perkins sighed. ""It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody
 else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,"" she said,
 smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.


 ""Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?""


 ""No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the
 dining room by myself.""


 A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had
 gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the
 top cabinet.
The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to
 herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter
 got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't
 complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive
 cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.
 And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.
 Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were
 seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's
 right.


 Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved
 from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the
 main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but
 she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more
 comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there
 for a long time, by herself, just thinking.


 But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,
 Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down
 across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.


 ""Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.""


 ""The little hag, you mean,"" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,
 but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.


 ""Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive
 me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.""


 ""Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,"" Darling said throatily,
 baring her teeth like a feline.


 ""My name is Perkins,"" Grandma smiled.


 ""I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great
 deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely
 child I've ever seen.""


 ""Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,"" Darling purred, starting to preen just
 a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.


 ""Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,"" Grandma said as she turned
 her head aside as if in sorrow. ""They were all set to put her in an
 institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.
 I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A
 pity. She was so pretty, just like you.""


 Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.


 ""But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what
 Omar, my husband, used to say."" Grandma paused to wipe away a small
 tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. ""That reminds me,"" she
 said finally, ""I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.
 And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them
 with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at
 them. Now, where did I put them?"" Grandma opened her purse and began
 rummaging around in its voluminous confines.


 Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently
 and tip-toed out of the lounge.


 Grandma looked up from her search. ""Oh, my, they seem to have gone.""


 Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down
 a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. ""I'd like to see the
 pictures, Grandma.""


 ""Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but—"" she said quickly.


 ""Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?""


 ""I—"" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered
 little face pursed itself into a smile. ""There aren't any pictures,
 Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have
 to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show
 them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.""


 Johnny laughed. ""Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?""


 The old woman sighed. ""It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down
 and I'll tell it to you.""


 ""I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and
 listen.""


 ""Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.
 I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few
 years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and
 then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,
 with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just
 get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old
 woman like me."" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,
 remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down
 without his help, suppressed a smile on the word ""feeble.""


 ""There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being
 sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the
 money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children—all ten
 of them."" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. ""The
 rats,"" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was
 smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.


 ""To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.
 And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did
 embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but—""


 Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came
 the horrendous clang of the
Kismet's
general alarm, and on its heels,
 charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain
 Fogarty.


 ""PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!""
 he shouted at Johnny. ""Man your station! And you, Madam, to your
 quarters at once! PIRATES!"" he shouted again and barged through the
 door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.


 Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene
 calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little
 excitement after all.


 At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to
 think.


 ""If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,
 and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are
 around, but—"" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her
 scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain
 towards the bridge.
II


 The Starship
Kismet
was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation
 and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device
 and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.
 But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the
 situation facing her at the present. The
Kismet's
bridge was a welter
 of confusion.


 The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator
 was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been
 a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,
 suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto
 the bridge.


 ""What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing
 speed?""


 The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, ""Engine Room reports the
 engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the
 lights and vents on emergency power.""


 The Communications Officer spoke up. ""The pirate ship reports that
 they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will
 leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.""


 As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. ""Ahoy, STAR
Kismet
. Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll
 blast you off the map.""


 ""Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!"" cried the Captain. ""There are no
 pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes
 is the Space Patrol anyway?""


 The Communications Officer gulped. ""Er, ah, we got in contact with
 Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,
 and for us to wait for him.""


 Captain Fogarty snorted. ""Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,
 eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand
 by the guns!""


 ""The guns are useless,"" whined the Gunnery Officer. ""The atomics that
 run them won't operate at all. What will we do?""


 ""Ahoy, STAR
Kismet
. Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us
 in, or we won't spare a man of you,"" boomed the loudspeaker.


 ""Pirates going to board us. How nice,"" muttered Grandma to herself as
 she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.


 ""They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms
 still work. We'll kill 'em all!"" cried Captain Fogarty.


 ""We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you
 open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,"" came the voice
 over the radio.


 ""Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate
 on board my ship,"" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.


 ""Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,"" Grandma said half
 aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the
 deserted passageway.


 The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found
 it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself
 into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.
 She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic
 contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the
 metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she
 felt quite at ease.


 Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little
 room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and
 evacuated the air from the lock.


 A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite
 calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly
 marked:
EMERGENCY LOCK

 DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT


 The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit
 crackled with static. ""What are you doing here?"" demanded a voice over
 the suit radio.


 ""Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!"" she
 told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.


 ""What's your name?"" asked the voice.


 ""Darling Toujours, famous television actress,"" she lied quite calmly.


 ""That's the one, boys,"" said another voice. ""Let's go."" Catching hold
 of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space.
Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away
 from the
Kismet
, the men in the control room relaxed and began to
 take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was
 Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny
 body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.
 Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most
 of the other men.


 ""Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?"" said Lamps.


 Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way
 suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close
 to one another. ""You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just
 like old Captain Blackbrood.""


 ""You mean Blackbeard, Snake,"" said Lamps.


 ""Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.""


 One of the other men piped up. ""And to think we get the pleasurable
 company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides
 the money.""


 ""Aw, women are no dern good—all of them,"" said Snake.


 ""Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just
 apologize to the lady,"" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and
 fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.


 ""That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more
 comfortable without that space suit on,"" he said.


 ""Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,"" a small voice said
 over the suit's loudspeaker system.


 Lamps grinned. ""Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt
 you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.""


 ""But I feel much—much safer, if you know what I mean,"" said the voice.


 ""Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,
 can't—Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them
 things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you
 don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her
 attire.""


 As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. ""Okay,"" she
 told them. ""I give up. I can make it by myself."" She started to take
 the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off
 when the truth dawned on her companions.


 ""Holy Smoke (or something like that),"" said one of the men.


 ""Nippin' Nebulae,"" said another.


 ""It ain't Darling Toujours at all!"" cried Lamps.


 ""It ain't even no woman!"" cried Snake.


 ""I beg your pardon,"" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest
 of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. ""I am Mrs. Matilda
 Perkins.""


 When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, ""I think
 you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.""


 ""Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I
 overheard that you intended to board the
Kismet
, searching for only
 one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I
 guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping
 and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and
 you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?""


 ""Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just
 why did you do this to us?"" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.


 ""You never would have gotten inside the
Kismet
without my assistance.
 And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.


 ""Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the
 hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with
 me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your
 lives.""


 Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,
 giving them a withered little smile. ""And if you want to know why,
 well ... I was bored on the
Kismet
, and I thought how nice it would
 be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.""


 ""She's batty,"" moaned Snake.


 ""She's lost her marbles,"" muttered another.


 ""Let's toss her overboard right now,"" said still another.


 Lamps O'Toole took the floor. ""Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,""
 he said loudly. ""We got enough trouble as is. You know what would
 happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put
 the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the
 last kid."" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.


 ""Look, lady—""


 ""My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.""


 ""Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't
 really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the
 Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including
 freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the
 solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't
 giving permission to nobody these days."" Lamps flopped into one of the
 control seats and lit a cigarette.


 ""So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,
 and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides
 to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the
 money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.""


 Lamps sighed. ""Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom
 money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space
 Patrol.""


 ""Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates
 at this rate,"" Grandma told him. ""You should have known better than to
 take a woman at her word.""


 ""I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you
 back?"" suggested Snake hopefully.


 ""I haven't got any rich relatives period,"" she said pertly. Then she
 added, ""But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if
 you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.""


 ""I figured as much,"" Lamps said dolefully. ""Lookit, Grandma, the best
 thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.
 Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our
 necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.""


 ""Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,""
 Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.
 ""They like to have starved me to death on that
Kismet
.""


 ""We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub...."" Lamps began.


 ""Just show me the way to the kitchen,"" said Grandma.
